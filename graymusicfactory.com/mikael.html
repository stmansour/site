                    <div class="infohdr">Early Years:</div>
                    Mikael was born in Upplands Vasby, Sweden which boasts a chocolate factory and home to
                    the band “Europe” that had the epic rock hit ‘The Final Countdown’. So basically, chocolate and glam rock. :/

                    <div class="infohdr">Musical Life:</div>
                    As a young man Mikael was drawn to British Rock and his love of rhythm led him to buy a bass and taught himself to play by ear.

                    Mikael is a musical anomaly. He sang in a choir in Sweden as a child, but didn’t play in
                    bands until later in life. Content mastering bass in private with no plans of playing in
                    bands until a friend invited him to sit in on a jam session. That’s when he found out he
                    belonged in that environment and so did everyone else.
                    Mikael represents 50% of GRAY’s Scandanavian contingency.

                    <div class="infohdr">Professional Life:</div>
                    Mikael came to the U.S. in 2012 to run a development team at Oracle. It’s amazing that
                    Mikael taught himself bass and didn’t play in his first band until xxx and has become a core member of GRAY.
