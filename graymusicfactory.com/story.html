                    GRAY combines the melodies and harmonies of traditional pop with progressively arranged
                    production styles, to create our own unique brand of progressive pop (GRAY pop). Now
                    combine this with life experience, our love of story
                    telling and a dash of a wry (if not warped) sense of humor . . . . this is the world of GRAY.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>The Forming of GRAY</b><br>
                    Gray Music Factory was founded in 2020 by a group of skilled musicians,
                    artists, and a master of arrangement and production (Steve Mansour) who
                    are obsessed with cool music telling original stories through great music,
                    audio and visual productions.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>The Backstory of GRAY</b><br>
                    At one point, in the early lives of each of our members, falling in love
                    and raising families was chosen over the risk and struggles that can
                    plague the life of professional musicians and production professionals. The
                    common factor among GRAY members is that the burning passion to create music never subsided.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fortunately, most members of GRAY found that their chosen careers (high
                    tech and creative servitude) actually enhanced the skills that allow them
                    to create and produce music on a level that independent artists
                    rarely have the opportunity to realize.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through the years and along the California Coast, these professionals
                    found each other through happenstance and random connections to literally evolve into
                    GRAY. The realization that there was a fortunate combination of
                    like-minded passions along with the diversity of skills to create
                    such a thing as GRAY, began to coalesce spontaneously.
                </p>
                <h3>PRE-HISTORY of GRAY (Steve & Matt)</h3>
                <p><b>Steve meets Matt (a small ‘dint’ in the universe)</b><br>
                    Like so many things that come to fruition, the seeds of GRAY we planted long before now.
                    Back in 1977 through a random meeting in the basement of a middle class neighborhood of
                    Independence, Missouri.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just by chance, Matt was invited to the house of his friend whose brother was none other
                    than Steve Mansour. Upon meeting they were surprised to find that they both wrote original
                    songs (an oddity in Kansas City on those days) and that Steve, not only had a home music
                    studio (even more of an oddity back then), but had free access to the first and ONLY
                    16-track studio in the entire city!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Steve was an incredible musician and was already learning advanced arrangement and
                    production at the big studio and invited Matt to accompany him on weekends. The studio
                    would not be available to them until after 11 pm on Friday
                    and Saturday nights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While other people were out partying, Steve guided Matt in the arts of the studio.
                    Together they would create, experiment and produce until early morning the next day. That’s
                    when the regular staff and ‘paying’ clients arrived and kicked thwm out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fortunately, a 7-11 was within walking distance of the studio to provide nourishment
                    in the form of ‘Junkyard Dogs’, Slurpees and a wondrous myriad of delectable candies
                    and junk foods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Steve and Matt go Silicon Valley (then LA)</b><br>
                            Silicon Valley called on Steve to become part of the early high-tech movement in 1980. Still writing together, Matt soon moved out to continue writing with Steve (and also got sucked up into the burgeoning technology
                            vortex).
                </p>
                <p>
                    While Steve’s career and falling in love with a fellow programmer kept him in Cupertino, Matt took their music and moved to Los Angeles (with his newly printed wife in 1985) where Chapel Hill Publishing, Columbia Records,
                    Arista and EMI were pushing for them to be artists. Unfortunately, Steve and Matt wanted only to write at the time. Matt hated flying and Steve loved the studio (traveling has never been that enjoyable for either of them).
                    EMI eventually offered Matt a staff writing post to represent the both of them, but the realities of family and finances made it impossible to take a position that had no salary until published music had made the company
                    profit and those profits split down the middle. 1 year? 2 years? Ever? Wives don’t take kindly to that sort of ‘job’.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Obviously, they weren’t able to keep up with the demands of the music industry and settled into their eventual lives in corporate management. However, they never stopped meeting and writing about each new phase of their
                    lives, not really considering ever releasing the music at the time. For Steve and Matt It was for the love of writing and expression of life that they wrote.They say it was a form of therapy and growth. But then, Ari came
                    along.
                </p><p>
                    <b>Then Came Ari</b><br>
                    Without Ari, there is no Gray Music Factory. The formation of this project was gleaned by Ari’s belief and desire to see this music.
                </p><p>
                    Ari pulled Steve back out into the sunlight to do some live playing and started the chatter that brought the ideas that turned into the GRAY Music Factory.
                </p><p>
                    When Ari introduced Mike (the original bass player of GRAY), other people around Steve started to solidify the idea of a band.
                </p><p>
                    Up to that point, there were several people involved in the recording of Steve & Matt’s music (hence the idea of the ‘Music Factory’), but the idea of a full fledged band was still out there in the ether.
                </p><p>
                    <b>GRAY’s Glue Arrives (Kyle & Ken)</b><br>
                    Eventually Steve & Ari met Ken Bauer (keyboards) & Kyle O’Leary (drummer), both from the high-tech industry. They were playing in a casual band that was formed from other high-tech connections.
                </p><p>
                    As standouts of the band, Ari thought they might have an interest in the Music Factory that was coming together.
                </p><p>
                    Kyle soon became the heartbeat of the band; not just literally, but figuratively. A standout drummer, Kyle had been a professional studio drummer in Nashville many years before. When he heard the original music, he committed to this new untried concept wholeheartedly. His talent and attitude was a turning point in the formation of GRAY. Kyle’s abilities and disposition are both steadying forces, without which GRAY may never have been completed.
                </p><p>
                    Ken brought a near lifetime of professional level keyboard playing while working a full career in high-tech (much of it in the music side of tech). As an advanced keyboardist, his amazing ability to provide both expert piano play along with emotional padding and perfectly timed inserts has been a godsend and essential for the full progressive sound of GRAY.
