                    GRAY combines the melodies and harmonies of traditional pop with progressively arranged
                    production styles, to create our own unique brand of progressive pop (GRAY pop). Now
                    combine this with life experience, our love of story
                    telling and a dash of a wry (if not warped) sense of humor . . . . this is the world of GRAY.

                    <b>The Forming of GRAY</b><br>
                    Gray Music Factory was founded in 2020 by a group of skilled musicians,
                    artists, and a master of arrangement and production (Steve Mansour) who
                    are obsessed with cool music telling original stories through great music,
                    audio and visual productions.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>The Backstory of GRAY</b><br>
                    At one point, in the early lives of each of our members, falling in love
                    and raising families was chosen over the risk and struggles that can
                    plague the life of professional musicians and production professionals. The
                    common factor among GRAY members is that the burning passion to create music never subsided.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fortunately, most members of GRAY found that their chosen careers (high
                    tech and creative servitude) actually enhanced the skills that allow them
                    to create and produce music on a level that independent artists
                    rarely have the opportunity to realize.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through the years and along the California Coast, these professionals
                    found each other through happenstance and random connections to literally evolve into
                    GRAY. The realization that there was a fortunate combination of
                    like-minded passions along with the diversity of skills to create
                    such a thing as GRAY, began to coalesce spontaneously.
