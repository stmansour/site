                    GRAY is a brand new band of hardened and grizzled musicians
                    and writers who escaped from the corporate world, now fueled
                    by an obsession to share the stories – our stories – of life, love and society.

                    GRAY Music Factory was founded in 2020 by a group of
                    skilled musicians, artists, and production
                    specialists who are obsessed with telling original stories through great
                    music and audio and visual productions.

                    over the the risk and struggles that can plague the life of
                    professional musicians. The common factor among GRAY members is that the burning passion to create
                    music never subsided.

                    The core of GRAY As a happy The members of GRAY found that their chosen careers (high tech,
                    creative servitude) actaully gave them skills

                    that independent artists had not imagined.

                     We have reached a
                    point in our lives where -->

                    <!-- But it all really
                    began back in 1977; an unlikely meeting in the basement of a
                    middle class neighborhood of
                    Kansas City, Missouri.
                    <br>
                    We are working on an original music launch with 3 new videos
                    that we expect to be out by the summer's end. This will be
                    the introduction to Gray Music Factory.
                    <br>
                    GRAY's launch begins with these 3 originals:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cute Little Lesbians</li>
                        <li>Living Life</li>

                    Two boys met, original songs were created and bonds were made that would span half a lifetime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, it is time. Children have grown, nest eggs were laid and the flame of passion burns hot as a stove.
                    Now it is time. It is time for 40 years of music that has been influenced by the ages to be unleashed.
