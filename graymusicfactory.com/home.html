                    Two boys met, original songs were created and bonds were made that would span half a lifetime.

                    Now, it is time. Children have grown, nest eggs were laid and the flame of passion burns hot as a stove.
                    Now it is time. It is time for 40 years of music that has been influenced by the ages to be unleashed.
