                    GRAY Music Factory was founded in 2020. But it all really
                    began back in 1977; an unlikely meeting in the basement of a middle class neighborhood of
                    Kansas City, Missouri.

                <p>
                    Two boys met, original songs were created and bonds were made that would span half a lifetime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, it is time. Children have grown, nest eggs were laid and the flame of passion burns hot as a stove.
                    Now it is time. It is time for 40 years of music that has been influenced by the ages to be unleashed.
