                    GRAY Music Factory was founded in 2020. But it all really
                    began back in 1977; an unlikely meeting in the basement of a middle class neighborhood of
                    Kansas City, Missouri.
                    <br>
                    We are working on an original music launch with 3 new videos
                    that we expect to be out by the summer's end. This will be
                    the introduction to Gray Music Factory. GRAY is a group of
                    highly skilled musicians, artists, and production
                    specialists who are crazed and obsessed.
                    <br>
                    GRAY's launch begins with these 3 originals:
                    <ul>
                    <li>Cute Little Lesbians</li>
                    <li>Living Life</li>
                    <li>Wall Of Love</li>
                    <ul>

                <p>
                    Two boys met, original songs were created and bonds were made that would span half a lifetime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, it is time. Children have grown, nest eggs were laid and the flame of passion burns hot as a stove.
                    Now it is time. It is time for 40 years of music that has been influenced by the ages to be unleashed.
