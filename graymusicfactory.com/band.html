<span class="infohdr">
    Ari: Lead Guitarist, Technical Audio Engineer
</span>
<br><br><span class="infosubhdr">Early Years:</span><br>
Ari was born in Kemi, Finland (60 miles south of the Arctic Circle - where nights are only 15 minutes in June and home of the world’s largest ‘snow fort’ and in view of the Northern Lights. This may explain why Ari wears sunglasses to bed.
<br><br><span class="infosubhdr">Musical life:</span><br>
His uncle was the inspiration that got him to start playing guitar at 15.
Ari played in various bands over the years.
Ari is truly a Scandanavian eclectic. He played - as the token Scandanavian - in a Bay Area Taiwanese rock/pop band ("Idea Band"). But, he also played in several bay area bands while trying to figure what Idea Band members where saying about him.
<br><br><span class="infosubhdr">Professional Life:</span><br>
After high school Ari studied electrical engineering and worked his entire career in high tech as a programmer and IT systems architect.
Ari worked (as a software architect) with Steve Mansour at eBay for several years.
There he became aware of the solo productions Steve was doing from home.
He subsequently invited Steve to play with he and Mikaels’s band at a summer event (Solstice Jam).
After that experience they got more serious. Ari set up an advanced monitoring
system. With Mikael on bass they began to develop more sophisticated arrangements,
harmonies, Abbleton Live, MIDI switching settings.
<br><br><span class="infosubhdr">Turn Ons:</span><br>
Walks in the rain. Watching the sunset with his pet narwhal. Eating sushi in Mexican restaurants.
<br><br><span class="infosubhdr">Turn Offs:</span><br>
Fakers, haters, space invaders, paint vapors, craters & rude waiters.

<span class="infohdr">
    Ken: Keyboards
</span>
<br><br><span class="infosubhdr">Early life:</span><br>
A true son of SoCal, Ken was born in Long Beach CA and grew up in the City of Orange. He soon began playing guitar and keyboards for cover bands in the 80s, before embarking on his Silicon Valley Career.
<br><br><span class="infosubhdr">Music life:</span><br>
From 12 years old Ken started playing in neighborhood bands. He soon began playing guitar and keyboards for a SoCal band ‘Matrix’ in the 80s.
Ken knew members of the band Steve, Ari & Mikael were playing with. After trying out several keyboardists without success. Ken was asked to sit in on a rehearsal and it was magic. Ken was an instant hit. Not only a great keyboardist with great chops, but a total team player who was essential to the formation of Gray.
Another exciting aspect of Ken is that he also writes music. Keep your eye on this space (link?).
<br><br><span class="infosubhdr">Professional Life:</span><br>
Ken spent his career as an electronic engineer with Silicon Valley stalwarts Apple and Broadcom. During his engineering career, Ken not only played in bands, but designed and built synthesizers, mixers, preamps and other music gear, including designs for the M-Audio Midiman.
Ken also builds and plays his own guitars. (pic?)

    Mikael: Bass, vocals
</span>
<br>
Mikael was born in Upplands Vasby, Sweden which boasts a chocolate factory and had a band called “Europe” that had a chart hit ‘The Final Countdown’. So basically, chocolate and glam rock. :/
While running a development team at Oracle, Mikael loved the concept of rhythm and taught himself bass to play xxxxx picked and has earned his place as one of the integral parts of GMF as a highly competent musician and vocalist. Mikael was playing with the band for the ‘Summer Solstice’ project where he and Ari met Steve.
Ari worked (as a software architect) with Steve at eBay for several years. He was aware of the solo productions Steve did privately at his home.
Solstice for fun. Next year they got more serious. Ari set up an advanced monitoring system. With Mikael on bass they began to develop more sophisticated arrangements, harmonies, Abbleton life, MIDI switching settings.
The next year, Ari, Mikael and Steve decided to start a whole new project for playing original music on a much more advanced level.
Lacking a keyboardist, another member of the ‘Solstice’ band knew keyboardist Ken Bauer. Ken listened to the music and said he’d like to give it a try.
Now, the band was struggling to find a drummer with the talent and know how to integrate into the technical features of the band, Ken approached Kyle and the same thing happened. Kyle listened to the music and agreed to sit in. After the very first song, the band knew he was the one.
The one thing everyone understood was that the goal was not to make money, but to introduce original music to people.
They contacted Steve to play in a band at an event called the ‘Solstice’. Mikael Vidstadt was the bass player of that band.

    Kyle: Drums
</span>
<br>
Kyle: Drummer

<br><br><span class="infosubhdr">Early Years:</span><br>

Born and raised in Denver, Colorado.

<br><br><span class="infosubhdr">Musical Life:</span><br>

Kyle fell in love with the drums at 10 years of age; hit the road at 18 playing music full time.  Ended up in LA at 21, and Nashville at 25.  Recorded an album for Freda Parton (Dolly's little sister). This band was assembled by Richie Owens (Dolly's cousin) and was offered its own pre-production deal with Warner Bros.
The old story of egos and attitudes led to the wheels falling off the deal and Ken decided to quit the music industry altogether.
After moving to the Silicon Valley and starting his own business, he decided to pick up his sticks almost 20 years to the day he left music and fell in love with it all over again.
He soon joined a classic rock cover band where he met GRAY’s keyboardist (Ken Bauer).
For those of you not familiar with the trials and tribulations of putting a good band together, finding the right drummer is extremely difficult. So, of course the last piece of the puzzle was to find that drummer. Many drummers auditioned and nothing worked.
Ken asked Kyle to sit in with the band. Within two songs Steve instantly knew they’d found GRAY’s drummer and as Kyle likes to say, ‘The rest is history in the making’.
