                    <div class="infohdr">Early Years:</div>
                    Kyle was born and raised in Denver, Colorado.

                    He doesn’t like to talk about it, but was told he grew up with a colorful cast of characters (Stan, Butters, Jimmy, Timmy and school sociopath Eric).

                    <div class="infohdr">Musical Life:</div>
                    Kyle fell in love with the drums at 10 years of age; hit the road at 18 playing music full time.  Ended up in LA at 21, and Nashville at 25.  Dolly Parton’s cousin (Richie Owens) formed a band with Kyle on drums, to play and record for Freda Parton (Dolly's little sister). This band was assembled by Richie Owens (Dolly's cousin) and offered its own pre-production deal with Warner Bros.

                    The old story of egos and attitudes led to the wheels falling off the deal and the disappointment led to Ken walking away from the music industry. This sabbatical turned into 20 years when he found himself in Silicon Valley and being sucked into the computer revolution.

                    Almost 20 years to the day he left music and fell in love with it all over again.

                    He soon joined a classic rock cover band where he met Ken Bauer (who would later become GRAY’s keyboardist).

                    For those of you not familiar with the trials and tribulations of putting a good band together, finding the right drummer is extremely difficult. So, of course the last piece of the puzzle was to find that drummer. Many drummers auditioned and nothing worked.

                    Ken asked Kyle to sit in with the band. Within two songs Steve instantly knew they’d found GRAY’s drummer and as Ken likes to say, ‘The rest is history in the making’.

                    After putting away his sticks, Kyle moved to northern California, went back to school and built up a successful business as an IT Consultant.
