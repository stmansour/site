                    Steve was born and raised in Kansas City, Missouri - the land of ubiquitous stockyards and kick-ass barbeque.
                    Steve was a - how should we say this? - an ‘interesting’ kid. Not your average, run of the mill, garden variety, pre-pubescent, cartoon watching kid.

                    By the age of 10 he had created his own ‘drum kit’ out of an assemblage of discarded boxes, plastic lidded coffee cans (for toms) and a cookie
                    tin nailed to a stick for his symbol.

                    On this ‘rig’ he taught himself drums from the Sergio Mendez ‘Brazil ‘66’ album. Get the picture?

                    Gradually he traded the coffee cans for a crappy ‘Recco’ (cheap) drum set, got exposed to the Beatles & a myriad of other popular bands. By the
                    time he was 13, Steve had acquired a second-hand guitar (later a bass) so he could learn ALL the parts from his favorite songs.

                    When he learned that it was possible for a single individual to use a multitrack tape recorder to make a recording that sounded like a full band,
                    he dedicated two summers as a fry cook to earn enough money to get one of the early 4-channel multitrack recorders. By the age of 16 he started playing and
                    producing covers, leading to creating and writing original material. He is a self-taught drummer, guitarist, bassist, keyboardist and singer that
                    eventually learned to play and sing what he needed to produce his own music.

                    This was the dawning of the era where an individual could fully produce music without a band. This was the door Steve went through.  Now Steve
                    could experiment, learn, produce and write as he pleased! That is, until he was so rudely interrupted by someone who would RUIN EVERYTHING!
                    (His name was Matt; more about this debacle later).

                    As a young college student, Steve was exposed to computers and was enamoured with what they could do. Switched his major from law to computer science and went on to become a Software Engineering Director with computer stalwarts, such as Apple, eBay, and Netscape.
                    All the while, he was recording original music he was writing with his song-writing partner (Matt).
