                    Steve was born and raised in Kansas City, Missouri - the land of ubiquitous stockyards and kick-ass barbeque.
                    Steve was a - how should we say this? - an ‘interesting’ kid. Not your average, run of the mill, garden variety, pre-pubescent, cartoon watching kid.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <div class="infohdr">Music Life:</div>
                    By the age of 10 he had created his own ‘drum kit’ out of an assemblage of discarded boxes, plastic lidded coffee cans (for toms) and a cookie
                    tin nailed to a stick for his symbol.

                    On this ‘rig’ he taught himself drums from the Sergio Mendez ‘Brazil ‘66’ album. Get the picture?

                    Gradually he traded the coffee cans for a cheap set of real drums, got exposed to the Beatles & a myriad of other popular bands. By the
                    time he was 13, Steve was playing drums in local bands. He had also acquired a second-hand guitar (later a bass) so he could learn ALL
                    the parts from his favorite songs.

                    When he learned that it was possible for a single individual to use a multitrack tape recorder to make a recording that sounded like a full band,
                    he dedicated two summers as a fry cook to earn enough money to get a one of the first 4-channel multitrack recorders (TEAC 3340). By the age of
                    16 he started playing and
                    producing covers, leading to creating and writing original material. He is a self-taught drummer, guitarist, bassist, keyboardist and singer that
                    eventually learned to produce his own music. This was the dawning of the era where an individual could fully produce music without a band.
                    This was the door Steve went through.  Now Steve could experiment, learn, produce and write as he pleased! That is, until he was so rudely
                    interrupted by someone who would RUIN EVERYTHING! (His name was Matt; more about this debacle later).

                    <div class="infohdr">Professional Life:</div>
                    As a young college student, Steve was exposed to computers and was enamoured with what they could do. Switched his major from law to electrical
                    engineering. He worked as an electrical engineer for 2 year then switched to software and went on to become a Software Engineering Director with
                    computer stalwarts, such as Apple, eBay, Paypal, and Netscape. All the while, he was recording original music he was writing with his
                    song-writing partner (Matt).

                    <div class="infohdr">Rumours:</div>
                    There’s a story about Steve (hardly worth mentioning, so, yea, let's talk about it) being kidnapped by a band of ‘Beatniks’ at the age of 9,
                    who ‘force-read’ him passages from Jack Kerouac writings.
                    Some say the ordeal resulted in a condition called P.O.D. (Permanent Observation Disorder). When pressed Steve was once quoted as saying,
                    ‘It was harrowing, yes, but I did learn how to play a mean bongo. As an added bonus, I can make menial observations that serve no purpose.’
                    While being held in the beatnik commune, he was, supposedly, abducted by the dreaded Andrew Sisters (of ‘Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy’
                    fame). Regarding this second kidnapping, Steve commented, ‘It was equally as harrowing, but the harmonies were GREAT!’
