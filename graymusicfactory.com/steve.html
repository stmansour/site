                    <div class="infohdr">Background:</div>
                    Steve was born and raised in Kansas City, MO - the land of ubiquitous stockyards and kick-ass barbeque.
                    Steve started drums at age 10, played in bands at 13, taught himself to play guitar, bass, and keyboards by 16,
                    had a small recording studio at 17, and was a session musicican at local recording studios by 18.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <div class="infohdr">Professional Life:</div>
                    Steve is an electrical engineer (EE) by degree, but worked as a software developer and executive for most of his career
                    at some of the most recognizable companies in Silicon Valley: Netscape, eBay, Paypal, and Apple.

                    <div class="infohdr">Rumors:</div>
                    It is said that Steve was kidnapped by a band of beatniks when he was 7. They ‘force-read’ him passages from Jack Kerouac writings.
                    Some say this resulted in a condition called P.O.D. (Permanent Observation Disorder). Allegedly, he said of the ordeal
                    ‘It was harrowing, yes, but I did learn how to play a mean bongo. Plus, I can make menial observations that serve no purpose.’
                    While being held in the beatnik commune, he was, abducted (again) by the dreaded Andrew Sisters (Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy).
                    Steve allegedly said of the incident, ‘It was equally as harrowing, but the harmonies were great!’

                    He couldn't think of any. Oh... wait... Hi-Boy burgers.

                    <div class="infohdr">Turn Offs:</div>
                    Trying to think of 'turn ons', people who pronounce nuclear as nucyooler,
                    that sweet Chinese red-bean-soup dessert stuff.
