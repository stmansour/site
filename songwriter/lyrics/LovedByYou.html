<h1>Loved By You</h1>
<p><em>Words and Music by Matt Kramer and Steve Mansour</em></p>
<p>
I'd pay any price<br>
Just to be loved by you<br>
I'd pay it twice<br>
You can believe it's true<br>
Give up all my possessions<br>
They're no longer so dear<br>
This is my confession<br>
That I want you to hear</p>
<p>I'd give it all<br>
Just to be loved<br>
Oh loved by you<br>
<br>
When I hear you call<br>
I'll come and rescue you<br>
I'd scale any wall<br>
If that's what I had to do<br>
I'll bring you a candle<br>
When you need light<br>
Look through my heart's window<br>
And see my motives tonight</p>
<p>And that's to be loved<br>
Just to be loved<br>
Oh loved by you</p>
<p>Give up all my possessions<br>
They're no longer so dear<br>
When I think of my wishes<br>
One thing is abundantly clear</p>
<p>I'd do anything<br>
Just to be loved by you<br>
Yea I want to be loved<br>
Oh loved by you<br>
Yea I want to be loved<br>
to be loved oh loved by you</p>
