    <h1>Livin' Life</h1>
    <p><em>Words and Music by Matt Kramer and Steve Mansour</em></p>
    <p>I've been thinking 'bout this caged-in life<br>
        and I'm feeling life just pass me by<br>
        so I'm calling up my boys tonight<br>
        night is falling, so just one more time<br>
        <br>
        I said Hey, I said Hey Tonight<br>
        Singing Cheers while we're here for just one more time<br>
        Let's go out with a blast, and let's do it right<br>
        One more time... Livin' Life<br>
        <br>
        too much drinking, I hear nature's call<br>
        counting cracks in this grimy bathroom wall<br>
        seeing double, don't think I should drive<br>
        I should stop now, while I can still count to five<br></p>
    <p>But it's Hey, Hey, Hey, I said Hey tonight<br>
        Singing Cheers while we're here for just one more time<br>
        Let's go out with a blast, and let's do it right<br>
        One more time... Livin' Life</p>
    <p>We're not as young as we used to be<br>
        but we're taking this chance<br>
        We're gonna make us some history<br>
        while there's still time to dance</p>
    <p>I said Hey, Hey, Hey, I said Hey tonight<br>
        Singing Cheers while we're here for just one more time<br>
        Let's go out with a blast, and let's do it right<br>
        One more time... Livin' Life</p>
    <p>I said Hey tonight<br>
        Singing Cheers while we're here for just one more time<br>
        Let's go out with a blast, and let's do it right<br>
        One more time... Livin' Life</p>
