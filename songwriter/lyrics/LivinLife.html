    <h1>Livin' Life</h1>
    <p><em>Words and Music by Matt Kramer and Steve Mansour</em></p>
    <p>
        And I’m thinking<br>
        ‘Bout this caged in life<br>
        Can’t help feelin’<br>
        Life has passed me by<br>
        <br>
        And I don’t understand<br>
        The point of it all sometimes<br>
        Or a mouse in a trap<br>
        That struggles before it dies<br>
        <br>
        So I’m callin’<br>
        Up my boys tonight<br>
        Night is falling<br>
        So let’s do this one more time<br>
        <br>
        I said Hey,<br>
        Gonna play tonight<br>
        Pour a round<br>
        Drink it down<br>
        And the next one's mine<br>
        Let's go out with a blast, and let's do it right<br>
        One more time<br>
        Living Life<br>
        <br>
        too much drinking, I hear nature's call<br>
        counting cracks in this grimy bathroom wall<br>
        seeing double, don't think I should drive<br>
        I should stop now, while I can still count to five<br></p>
    <p>But it's Hey, Hey, Hey,<br>
        Life's okay tonight<br>
        While we're here<br>
        Commandeer<br>
        All the hootch in sight<br>
        Let's go out with a blast, and let's do it right<br>
        One more time<br>
        Livin' Life</p>
    <p>We're not as young as we used to be<br>
        but we're taking this chance<br>
        We're gonna make us some history<br>
        while there's still time to dance</p>
    <p>I said Hey, Hey, Hey, I said Hey tonight<br>
        Singing Cheers while we're here for just one more time<br>
        Let's go out with a blast, and let's do it right<br>
        One more time... Livin' Life</p>
