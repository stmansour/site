<p><b><font size="6">She Wants Your Money</font></b></p>
<p><em>Words and Music by Matt Kramer and Steve Mansour</em></p>
<p>
  
<font size="2">You look to her and say your looking for love<br>
But she needs more, love ain't enough<br>
You want a ride to give you a thrill<br>
But she wants somebody who's going to<br>
Pay her bills</font></p>
<p>

<font size="2">She wants your money<br>
She wants your money</font></p>
<p>

<font size="2">You want to live out your dreams of unspeakable lust<br>
She says, &quot;Repeat after me: In God We Trust&quot;<br>
Benjamin Franklin and all of his friends</font><br>
<font size="2">These are the men on whom she can depend</font></p>
<p>

<font size="2">She wants your money<br>
She wants your money<br>
She wants your money<br>
and then she's gonna love you tonight</font></p>
<p>

<font size="2">She says,<br>
I want your money, I want you rmoney<br>
give me your money, give me your money<br>
I want your money, give me your money<br>
I want your money, give me your money</font></p>
<p>

<font size="2">Cash that's cold, that's what counts<br>
You'll have to bid the highest amount<br>
Your talk and bullshit won't get it done<br>
You'd best get ready she ain't looking for love</font></p>
<p>

<font size="2">She wants your money<br>
She wants your money<br>
She wants your money<br>
and then she's gonna love you tonight<br>
Can't you see, she just wants your money now<br>
and then she's gonna love you tonight</font></p>
