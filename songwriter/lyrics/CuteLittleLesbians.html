<p>You got me down on my knees<br>
  You got me climbing the trees<br>
  Bangin&rsquo; the drum<br>
  For cute little lesbians
</p>
<p>Some boys are so scared they run <br>
  Ohhh ohhh, but to me<br>
  It&rsquo;s not worth it to mention<br>
  Ohh, Ohh<br>
  She&rsquo;s smilin&rsquo; like Elvis, when she sees that hot little girl go by<br>
  Waggin&rsquo; her pelvis, Just like a guy
</p>
<p>These girls just wanna&rsquo; have fun,<br>
  But I think I&rsquo;m fallin&rsquo; in love,<br>
  They drive me wild<br>
  Cute Little Lesbians<br>
  Cute little lesbians</p>
<p>Most girls just don&rsquo;t have the stuff <br>
  Ohhh ohhh<br>
  To play the part of the femme-fe-tough<br>
  She wonders sometimes, what it is like, to have what I have, and have it all night<br>
  To flash it, and wield it, admire it and feel it and plunge it like a knife</p>
<p>And if she wants to include<br>
  A friend, well, I won’t refuse<br>
  But I love only one<br>
  Cute little lesbian</p>
<p>Cute, cute, cute, Little Lesbians<br>
  Cute, cute, cute, Little Lesbians</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never ask of you to change your ways<br>
  You know I&rsquo;ll love you &lsquo;til the end of days<br>
  I&rsquo;ll be right here when others run, run, run<br>
  Count on me to always come, come, come, come</p>
<p>So, why don&rsquo;t you throw <br>
  Ohh, ohh<br>
  A little look my way<br>
  You might even like it<br>
  What&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; in our way</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cause I know you girl, I know how you think, <br>
  that man&rsquo;s at his best when he&rsquo;s fixin&rsquo; your sink<br>
  But, who better to covet your gender and love it, <br>
  and protect you while you sleep</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got me down on my knees,<br>
  You got me climbin&rsquo; the trees,<br>
  Bangin&rsquo; the drum,<br>
  For cute little lesbians</p>
<p>Cute, cute, cute, Little Lesbians<br>
Cute, cute, cute, Little Lesbians</p>
<p>Just me and you and your little girlfriend<br>
  Me and you and your little girlfriend<br>
  Me and you and your little girlfriend too</p>
<p></p>
