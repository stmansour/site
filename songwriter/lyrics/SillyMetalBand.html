<h1>Silly Metal Band</h1>
<em>Words and Music by Matt Kramer and Steve Mansour</em>
<p>Gotta tell you<br>
Tell you right now<br>
I know what you're feeling in side<br>
you want my touch
<br>
I will make you feel it somehow<br>
but don't make me play you rough<br>
you want my touch</p>
<p>

Yea, girl you make me crazy<br>
You wear that Silly Metal Band<br>
No that don't mean nothin'<br>
What you need is a man
<br><br>
Come on, <br>
Let me hear you say it out loud<br>
Don't keep it locked inside<br>
Afraid to let it out<br>
The time you spend away is keeping you down<br>
Don't be afraid of me<br>
You want my touch</p>
<p> Yea, girl you make me crazy<br>
You wear that Silly Metal Band<br>
No that don't mean nothin'<br>
What you need is a man </p>
<p>Get it through your mind<br>
  Get it through your mind<br>
  Get it through your mind<br>
  Gonna make you mine<br>
  Gonna make you mine<br>
Gonna make you mine</p>
<p>Gotta tell you<br>
  Tell you right now<br>
  I want your touch<br>
  I will make you feel it somehow<br>
  But don't make me play you rough<br>
  You want my touch</p>
