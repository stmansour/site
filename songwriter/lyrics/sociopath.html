                    <br> Howl at the moon
                    <br> Hide in the dark
                    <br> Gonna make a meal out of someone looking for love
                    <br> Singing my tune
                    <br> Baiting a mark
                    <br> I&#39;m taking everything she&#39;s got, and it&#39;s still not enough<br>
                    <br> Why do you still believe in fairy tales
                    <br> That things too good can still be true
                    <br> You thought your time has come for happiness
                    <br> But that is not what&#39;s happening to you<br>
                    <br>

                    <br> I&#39;m a sociopath
                    <br> I lie and paint wonderful dreams
                    <br> Now, I&#39;m gone from this place
                    <br> Without a trace
                    <br> And I&#39;ve taken everything<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="lyriclabel">VERSE 2</span>
                    <br> Lying in wait
                    <br> For susceptible hearts
                    <br> Wearing Prada & Gucci (brands) preferably
                    <br> I don&#39;t feel a thing
                    <br> I just play a part
                    <br> I&#39;ve only one concern and that is only me<br>
                    <br> How can I do this all so easily
                    <br> Over and over again
                    <br> So many people put their trust in me
                    <br> Before they realize I&#39;m not their friend<br>
                    <br>

                    <br> Everything&#39;s part of a scheme<br>
