<h1>Talk To Her</h1>

<p><em>Words and Music by Matt Kramer and Steve Mansour</em></p>

<p>We only met last 
night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>You shouldn't fault her</i><br>
Can't get her off my mind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Why don't you call her</i><br>
But what am I supposed to do <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>You've got to make a choice</i><br>
She'll think I'm such a fool<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>You want to hear her voice</i></p>
<p>When my heart comes out from hidin' it will be flyin' flyin'<br>
<br>
I wanna' tell her when I'm not with her that I feel alone<br>
I just wanna' talk to her on the telephone<br>
It's gotta' be tonight</p>
<p>I gotta cool down, wait two days<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>You're stalling right on cue</i><br>
She got me stunned &amp; dazed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Time's escaping you </i><br>
The thought of her makes me smile<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>That you should not 
ignore</i><br>
&nbsp;This feelin' drives me will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>What are you waiting for</i></p>
<p>Why do I run for cover why can't I say I love her<br>
<br>
I wanna' tell her when I'm not with her that I feel alone<br>
I just wanna' talk to her on the telephone<br>
It's gotta' be tonight</p>
<p>What kind of fool <br>
would blow the chance<br>
to dance the dance <br>
with a girl like that</p>
<p>Hey I think I'll tell her<br>
that I feel alone<br>
I just want to talk to her<br>
on the telephone<br>
tonight</p>
