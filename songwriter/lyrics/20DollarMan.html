<h1>Twenty Dollar Man</h1>
<p><em>Words and music by Matt Kramer and Steve Mansour</em></p>
<p>When my wife leaves home each mornin'<br />
she puts into my hand<br />
a crisp new $20 bill<br />
and this is what she says:<br />
Try doing something useful...<br />
Maybe like a job<br />
But ohhhhhhh<br />
When that door goes SLAM!</p>
<p>I'm the twenty dollar man</p>
<p>Then I go out lookin'<br />
How this twenty should be spent<br />
And workin' on my story<br />
'bout where the money went<br />
well you know I love the ladies<br />
and you know they love me too<br />
they ain't no crime in lookin'<br />
if lookin's all I do...<br />
...oww<br />
look at that, look at that<br />
you tall cool drink of water<br />
just reach in to the pockets of my pants<br>
and you'll know
</p>
<p>I'm the twenty dollar man</p>
<p>Twenty dollar, twenty dollar man<br>
  the man's got a twenty dollar bill in his hand<br>
It's OK, it's alright<br>
the man make a twenty dollar bill last all night<br>
Twenty dollar, twenty dollar man<br>
the man's got a twenty dollar bill in his hand<br> 
Livin' it up while he can</p>
<p>I'm the twenty dollar man</p>
<p>Don't know what's in the bible,<br />
the vedas or koran<br />
  But I do know there's a twenty dollar<br />
  bill here in my hand<br />
  So gather 'round you lovely ladies<br />
  Let's order up some food<br />
  And pour that Southern Comfort<br />
That puts me in the mood</p>
<p>Livin' it up, livin' it up<br>
  Come on, tell me how you can<br>
  I'm the twenty dollar man<br>
Livin' it up, livin' it up<br> 
Actin' like it's 15 grand<br>
I'm the twenty dollar man
</p>
<p>Twenty dollar , he the twenty dollar man<br>
  give it on up for the man with twenty dollars<br>
  Two tens, four fives, the man can make it last all night<br>
Twenty dollar man, uh-huh, gimme gimme</p>
