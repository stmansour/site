<h1>Remember The Ride</h1>
<p><em>Matt Kramer, Steve Mansour</em></p>

<br>Her lover pulls up, she hops in the car
<br>The young pair go out for a ride
<br>Their map isn’t clear, the couple gets lost
<br>The waters begin to rise
<br>
<br>And now they are lost in time
<br>
<br>They swim their way out, they hop on the train
<br>To get their own piece of the pie
<br>They move their way up, but now have new dreams
<br>How they want to live their lives
<br>
<br>Before they get lost in time
<br>
<br>Remember, enjoy the ride
<br>Your never closer to paradise
<br>
<br>Children are born, children grow up
<br>Hoping that you've  raised them right
<br>They hop into cars of lover’s  their own
<br>heading into the tide
<br>
<br>Beginning the journey of time
<br>
<br>Where are we going, where have we been,
<br>With husbands and children & wives
<br>The circle of life has gotten so big
<br>That now it appears a straight line
<br>Riding into the sunset of time
<br>
<br>Remember, enjoy the ride
<br>You're never closer to paradise
<br>Remember the ride
