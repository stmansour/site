<p>If I built you house on top of a hill<br>
 With a picket fence all painted white<br>
 If I gave two children named Teddy &amp; Jill<br>
 And we loved them the whole of our lives</p>
 
<p>When I'd come home from work, and walk up the road<br>
 You'd hear me calling your name<br>
 And you'd see me smile as you answered back<br>
 And we'd kiss when you opened the gate</p>
 
<p>I long to have you<br>
 Next to me at night<br>
 Forever, if that's not enough</p>
 
<p>I swear I will<br>
 Love you until<br>
 The world stops circling the sun<br>
You'll never fear<br>
 As long as I'm m near<br>
 There's nothing you'll have to run from<br>
 If I do all this and I only ask for your love<br>
 Will you come</p>
<p>If I built you carriage with white satin seats<br>
 And drove you each Sunday through town<br>
 If I made you a drink that was cool and was sweet<br>
 In the green grass laid you down</p>
 
<p>If I wrote you song, and it made you cry<br>
 Then a story that made you laugh<br>
 And when we heard the music's centrifical beat<br>
 We would hold each other close as we danced</p>
 
<p>I'll take you the stars,<br>
 And the moon from the sky<br>
 And in my eyes you will always be young</p>
 
<p>I swear I will<br>
 Love you until<br>
 The world stops circling the sun<br>
You'll never fear<br>
 As long as I'm near<br>
 There's nothing you'll have to run from<br>
 If I do all this and I only ask for your love<br>
 Will you come</p>
  Bridge<br>
<p>I swear I will<br>
 Love you until<br>
 The world stops circling the sun<br>
You'll never fear<br>
 While I am near<br>
 There's nothing you'll have to run from<br>
 If I do all this and I only ask for your love<br>
 Will you come</p>
