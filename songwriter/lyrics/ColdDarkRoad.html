    <h1>Cold Dark Road</h1>
    <p><em>Matt Kramer, Steve Mansour</em></p>
    <br>
    <br>He worked hard
    <br>Every day
    <br>Sundays went to church
    <br>Taught his children how to pray
    <br>
    <br>But when the troubles of Wall Street
    <br>Came to town
    <br>The orders all dried up and
    <br>The factory got shut down
    <br>
    <br>He worked hard all his life
    <br>For the company, his little boy,
    <br>His daughter and his wife
    <br>And when they took his home
    <br>He sent them to his inlaws
    <br>So he could strike out on his own
    <br>
    <br>Singing Lord you’ve laid me low
    <br>There’s no jobs and there’s no work
    <br>And there’s nowhere left to go
    <br>And when things seem at their worst
    <br>You just add on another load
    <br>To carry down this
    <br>Cold Dark Road
    <br>
    <br>I remember
    <br>When I was still a man
    <br>Every other Friday
    <br>Put my paycheck in her hand
    <br>On weekends we would be out in the yard
    <br>The kids play (playin') on the swingset
    <br>As we worked on our cars
    <br>People I’ve known all my life
    <br>Lost everything they worked for
    <br>Left without a single dime
    <br>As they moved out one by one
    <br>The lights went out on this town
    <br>Like the setting of the sun
    <br>
    <br>Singing Lord you’ve laid me low
    <br>There’s no jobs and there’s no work
    <br>And there’s nowhere left to go
    <br>And when things seemed at their worst
    <br>You just add on another load
    <br>To carry down this
    <br>Cold Dark Road
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I was taught to fight
    <br>For what I know is right
    <br>But who I need to find (fight) will not come out
    <br>As they weave their webs
    <br>Sleep in expensive (their feathered) beds
    <br>Paid for by the sweat that
    <br>For years came from my brow
    <p></p>
