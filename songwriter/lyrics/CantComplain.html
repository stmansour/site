<h1>Can't Complain</h1>
 
<p><em>Words and Music by Matt Kramer and Steve Mansour</em></p>
<p>It happens two feet from the ground<br>
I catch me feelin' down<br>
before I look around</p>
<p>And though I say it only now and again<br>
in you I have a valued friend<br>
you'd see me through the end</p>
<p>And anytime I begin feeling pain<br>
I know I can't complain<br>
no I can't complain</p>
<p>At times you pull me from my cloud<br>
make me think aloud<br>
push me through the crowd</p>
<p>And deep inside I wish you well<br>
sometimes it's hard to tell<br>
I know it's hard to tell</p>
<p>But anytime you begin feeling pain<br>
you know you can't complain<br>
no you can't complain</p>
<p>Tell me, will you tell me what's to think<br>
will you tell me what's to do<br>
and I'll believe in you</p>
<p>Tell me, will you tell me where from here<br>
you know it's all so clear<br>
you know it's me and you<br>
me and you</p>
