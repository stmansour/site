<h1>Broken Glass</h1>
<p><em>Words and Music by Matt Kramer and Steve Mansour</em></p>
<p>Let's not even pretend that&nbsp;I've got hand,<br>
  You're holding all the cards, let's understand,<br>
  I'm done,<br>
  You won<br>
  <br>
  Can't go another step without you there,<br>
  I can't believe how much you make care,<br>
  About you,<br>
  Ooo oo oo<br>
  <br>
  If you say, I'll obey - BABY!<br>
  <br>
  I'll eat broken glass, if you want it,<br>
  Become a Democrat , if you want it<br>
  Believe in God, and help you shop for shoes<br>
  <br>
  I'll buy your Mary Kaye's if you want it,<br>
  Stay home and talk for days, if you want it,<br>
  Work out, lose weight, and grow a Fu Man Chu,<br>
  Just for you,<br>
  If that's what you want<br>
  <br>
  You're the only one of you, that's short supply,<br>
  You name the thing you want girl, I don't mind<br>
  The price,<br>
  It's right<br>
  <br>
  You want sincerity, look in my eyes,<br>
  I'm in no position now to tell you lies,<br>
  It's you<br>
  Ooo oo oo<br>
  <br>
  If you say, I'll obey - BABY!<br>
  <br>
  I'll eat broken glass, if you want it<br>
  I'll shave my head and chant, if you want it,<br>
  Drive to hell and back, or even Timbuktu,<br>
  <br>
  I'll open all your doors if you want it,<br>
  To restaurants and stores, if you want it<br>
  Push in your chair and order Cordon Bleu,<br>
  Anything for you, if that's what you want<br>
  <br>
  I'll eat broken glass, if you want it,<br>
  Fake a heart attack if you want,<br>
  I'll even learn to dance if you want it,<br>
  If you want it,&nbsp; If you want it,<br>
  I'll call you everyday if you want,<br>
  Without a thing to say, if you want it,<br>
  You'll never have to pay, if you want,<br>
  if you want it, If you want it,</p>
<p>If you want it,<br>
  if you want it,<br>
  if you want it,
<p>If that's what you want</p>
<p>If you want it,<br>
  if you want it,<br>
  if you want it,</p>
<p>If that's what you want</p>
