<h1>Reach Back in Time</h1>
  
<p><em>Words and Music by Matt Kramer and Steve Mansour</em></p>
<p>Tonight I'm trapped,<br>
 'Cause I saw your picture,<br>
 The memories it conjures can't find their way out of my head</p>
 
<p>But still,<br>
 I want you near me,<br>
 I want to say what I wish I had said</p>
 
<p>No answered calls,<br>
 No explanation<br>
 Memories, they hang<br>
 Like antiques upon walls</p>
  
<p>If I could reach back in time<br>
If I could change water to wine<i><br>
</i>First I'd kiss you - say a few magic words<br>
And the history I wanted with you has occurred<br>
 And your heart would be mine<br>
If I could reach back in time</p>
<p>Your face is my drug,<br>
Your smile my addiction,<br>
The taste of your lips stirring hopelessly 'round&nbsp; in my mind</p>
<p>I will, Make one proposition,<br>
Come back with my now,<br>
through the black's of my eyes</p>
<p>The past is my pain<br>
The present my prison<br>
 Goin back to the past <br>
is the only way out</p>
  
<p>If I could reach back in time<br>
If I could change water to wine<i><br>
</i>First I'd kiss you&nbsp;&nbsp;- say a few magic words<br>
And the history I wanted with you has occurred<br>
 And your heart would be mine<br>
If I could reach back in time</p>
<p>Yet years of time<br>
Miles in space<br>
Still the bookmark - has not lost its place</p>
<p>If I could reach back in time<br>
Reach back in time<br>
&nbsp;</p>
