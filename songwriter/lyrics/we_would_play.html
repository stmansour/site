<h2>We Would Play</h2>
 
<p><font size="1">Words and Music by Matt Kramer and Steve Mansour</font></p>

<p><b><font size="2" color="#3399FF">Verse</font><font size="2" color="#808080"><br>
</font></b><font size="2">Midnight, Kansas City</font>, at the local studio <br>
Waiting in the wings for everyone to go home<br>
The players got tired, they called it a wrap, <br>
They gave us the keys, and said &quot;you top that&quot;<br>
<br>
We laid down tracks from dusk until dawn (75th &amp; Troost)<br>
Livin' on tacos (&amp;Big Gulps) &amp; junk yard dogs<br>
In the morning, they'd come in, and we'd give 'em a play<br>
They'd nod to the beat and say, &quot;You boys are OK&quot;</p>
  <p><b><font size="2" color="#3399FF">Chorus</font><font size="2" color="#808080"><br>
  </font></b>In those days,<br>
We would play,<br>
Sparks flew from cymbals &amp; guitars<br>
  The tape spun like wheels on cars</p>
<p><b><font size="2" color="#3399FF">Post-Chorus:</font><font size="2" color="#808080"><br>
</font></b>You hate the world silly girl<br>
Mercury Queen don't go<br>
Ya' know money's all right<br>
Take a little chance, lay your heart down on a number</p>
<p><b><font size="2" color="#3399FF">Verse 2:</font><font size="2" color="#808080"><br>
</font></b>High tech called Steve to the Silicon show<br>
Matt packed his bags, came to Cupertino<br>
They kept on writin'&nbsp; &amp; started a band<br>
But as often with youth, everybody had their own plan</p>
<p>The pegasus flew, the pegasus crashed,<br>
Bonds were broken, dreams were dashed<br>
And everyone went their own separate ways,<br>
Girls were married and new plans were made</p>
<p><font color="#3399FF"><b>Bridge</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#3399FF"><b>8 bar musical bridge</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#3399FF"><b>8 bar vocal bridge<br>
</b></font>Different towns, different worlds<br>
More than twenty years, not a word,<br>
But the tunes never stopped swirling round in their heads,<br>
Sometimes it takes time to know what it meant<br>
<br>
<font size="2" color="#3399FF"><b>Chorus</b></font></p>
<p>It was fate,<br>
That we should play,<br>
Sparks fly from cymbals and guitars,<br>
No one's thinkin' 'bout bein' a star</p>
<p><font size="2" color="#3399FF"><b>Chorus</b></font></p>
<p>We just play<br>
And we play</p>
<p>Just play (harmonies)</p>
<p>And we play and we play, and we play, and we play<br>
Making songs, gettin' hot &amp; rockin' all day</p>
