<h1>Money's Alright</h1>
 
<p><em>Words and Music by Matt Kramer and Steve Mansour</em></p>
<p>Hey people <br>
won't you lend me your ears<br>
I've got something to say<br>
been building up for years<br>
<br>
Some folks will tell you<br>
money's not good stuff<br>
but you know deep inside<br>
that they can't get enough
</p>
<p>Your friends might turn their backs 
on you<br>
if the price is right<br>
oh you say they won't<br>
but you know they might for</p>
<p>Money, Money,<br>
Money, Money,<br>
Money, yes you know that Money's Alright</p>
<p>A paycheck, a handout<br>
a loan from a friend<br>
I don't care where it comes from<br>
I need some to spend</p>
<p>I can't stay home much longer<br>
and stare at these walls<br>
I need money to spend<br>
or do nothing at all</p>
<p>A date out on the town tonight<br>
or a Broadway show<br>
anything you do<br>
every place you go takes</p>
<p>I believe the game of life<br>
has an admission fee<br>
my girl once said you don't need money,<br>
that love's the key</p>
<p>You gotta be  kiddin' me</p>
<p>Well, please correct me if I'm wrong<br>
but I think I'm right<br>
If you do it wrong<br>
you can make it right with money</p>
<p>hey... I need it bad<br>
I need it oh so bad<br>
hey... you know what to bring<br>
it can buy you anything</p>
