                    <br> The garden where we used to walk
                    <br> today is marked with body chalk
                    <br> where my dreams died and fell
                    <br> How does love become a curse
                    <br> or a rich man die from thirst
                    <br> or heaven become hell
                    <br>
                    <br> You told me that you loved me
                    <br> Then took it all away
                    <br>
                    <br> You know you popped my red balloon
                    <br> served a steak with just a spoon
                    <br> stood an inch to far away
                    <br> When I had never loved before
                    <br> someone so much I adored
                    <br> such a waste and such a shame
                    <br>
                    <br> I need a change of venue
                    <br> It&#39;s time to take the pain
                    <br>
                    <span class="lyriclabel">CHORUS 1</span>
                    <br> I will be ready
                    <br> I will be strong
                    <br> To swim to shore before I drown
                    <br> I be steady
                    <br> When I walk into the storm
                    <br> I will
                    <br> gonna pack and leave this town<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="lyriclabel">VERSE 2</span>
                    <br> I have lingered way too long
                    <br> Where I know I don&#39;t belong
                    <br> But where I want to be
                    <br> The suit looks so good on the rack
                    <br> But looks atrocious on my back
                    <br> As everyone can see
                    <br>
                    <br> She&#39;s looking at me
                    <br> Like why is he still here
                    <br> The taste of shame still in my mouth
                    <br> How did this all come about
                    <br> Once, she wanted only me
                    <br> It's time that I take back my pride
                    <br> Kill this love and watch it die
                    <br> And wake up from this dream
                    <br>
                    <br> A wreck of twisted metal
                    <br> Shedding a gentle tear
                    <br>
                    <br><span class="lyriclabel">CHORUS 2</span>
                    <br> I will,I&#39;m ready
                    <br> I will be strong
                    <br> To swim to shore before I drown
                    <br> I will be steady
                    <br> When I walk into the storm
                    <br> I will
                    <br> Gonna pack and leave this town
                    <br>
