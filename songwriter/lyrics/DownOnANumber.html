    <h1>Down On A Number</h1>
    <p class="author">Words and Music by Matt Kramer and Steve Mansour</p>
    <p class="verse">
        <br> I've got a feeling
        <br> You can't get close, you're afraid
        <br> My heart is waiting
        <br> For you to get in the game
        <br>
        <br> When you see love do you see trouble
        <br> When you gave love did your heart crumble
        <br> You don't want to
        <br> see me go
    </p>
    <p class="push">
        <br> Girl, you don't want a wounded man
        <br> I really love you, but you must understand
    </p>
    <p class="chorus">
        <br> You've got to take a little chance
        <br> Lay your heart down on a number
        <br> You'll never find romance
        <br> Unless you play
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
    	<br>I can see that
        <br> funny look in your eye
        <br> You know you love me
        <br> so why do you want to hide
        <br>
        <br> When you see me do you see double
        <br> When we get close&nbsp; are you in trouble
    </p>
    <p class="push">
        <br> You know that you want to take my hand
        <br> I really want you, but you must take a stand
    </p>
    <p class="chorus">
    </p>
    <p class="section">SOLO</p>
    <p class="push">
        <br> Why would you want a wounded man
        <br> I really love you, don't you understand
        <br>
    </p>
    <p class="section">SOLO</p>
    <p>Lay your heart down on a number</p>
