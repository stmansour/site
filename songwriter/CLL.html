        <i>Some people have expressed concern that Cute Little Lesbians is an
        offensive song.  Without expressing my own opinion or Matt's, I sent
        out the lyrics to the song to 50 women and asked them if they found
        the song lyrics to be offensive. The age of the women ranged from
        21 to 72.  I realize that asking them whether or not the lyrics were
        offensive
        will cause them to approach the lyrics with a suspicious eye. But I
        wanted to know what they thought. After hearing back from all of them
        I summarized the results in the message below and sent it out to all
        the participants.</i>

    <br>
    <hr>
<p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1">Hi All,</p>
<p class="c1">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who responded to my request for comments, thoughts,
    criticisms, etc. about “Cute Little Lesbians”. This song was written by Matt
    Kramer and me  back in 2008 / 2009. We appreciate the time you took to
    provide feedback. I wanted to send this summary  to let you know that I
    actually read and thought about **all** of your responses and to explain
    what we intended to communicate in the song lyrics.
</p>
<p>For those who just want the quick summary...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0">
    Cute Little Lesbians is a love song about a young man who is fascinated by
    lesbians and who is in love with one lesbian in particular.
    He fantasizes and daydreams about her. The lyrics reveal that he would
    never ask her to change, he will always love her, he wants to protect her,
    and he fantasizes about her accepting him into her life. And in the
    tradition of rock and pop genres, the song is filled with sexual innuendos.
</span></p>
<br>
<p>Cute Little Lesbians  is musical art, not a political statement. But in these
    times when sensitivity to LGBTQ issues is so high, people are very sensitive
    when they see certain words. Based on many of the comments you provided and
    the follow-up discussions, it seems as though the  use of the term “lesbian”
    sometimes made people cautious or uneasy. But for the young man described in
    the lyrics the term “lesbian” is very normal, and in this case, endearing.
</p>

<p>I do like stats. Here are a few that you might find interesting.  We had 47 respondents.</p>

<p>PS:  Shortly after I finished the CLL video, one of the ladies who said that
    the lyrics offended her came to our house for dinner.
    I showed the video to them.  After the video finished, she smiled and said,
    "Forget what I said earlier, the lyrics are fine!"   Granted, she is a friend
    of ours but (a) she did not have an issue with telling me that the lyrics
    offended her when I initially asked, and (b) she did not have to tell me to
    "forget" her earlier comment.

    PPS: In August 2022, when Don Larson was auditioning to be bass player in GRAY,
    he mentioned that his daughter was gay. I asked him to have her listen to the
    song and let us know what she thought.  She did not know me or Matt.  Don
    informed me that she watched the video and she said she liked the song a lot.

<h1 class="c18" id="h.56kki3ad7lwf"><span class="c7">The Title: Cute Little Lesbians</span></h1>
<p>
    The title is the place to start. Some people said that the title is
    offensive, though it was difficult for anyone to explain why. Here is what I
    heard, along with some comments.
</p>
<p>
    <br>
    A couple of people suggested that the word &ldquo;cute&rdquo; made it
    offensive. In the case of the title, &ldquo;Cute&rdquo; is used here to
    describe a girl or woman with a pleasant or appealing face. Perhaps you have
    shown someone a picture and they said &ldquo;oh, she&rsquo;s cute.&rdquo;
    That is how we&rsquo;re using the term in the title.
</p>
<p>
    <br>
    Several people suggested that the word &ldquo;little&rdquo; made it
    offensive. In this case, &ldquo;little&rdquo; is used as a term of
    endearment. There are many song titles and lyrics that use
    &ldquo;little&rdquo; in this way: &ldquo;Sweet Little 16&rdquo;, &ldquo;
    My Little Darling&rdquo;, &ldquo;Go Away Little Girl&rdquo;, &ldquo;
    Little St. Nick&rdquo;, &ldquo;Run Little Linda&rdquo; &hellip; and hundreds
    more. &nbsp;Think about lyrics where &ldquo;little&rdquo; has been used in
    this way. &nbsp;From Stevie Ray Vaughn &ldquo;... she&rsquo;s my sweet
    little baby, I&rsquo;m her little lover boy&rdquo;; from the Ramones
    &ldquo;Hey, little girl I want to be your boyfriend&rdquo;; from the Everly
    Brothers &ldquo;wake up, little Susie, wake up&rdquo;... the list goes on
    and on. In all of those examples, &ldquo;little&rdquo; is used as a term of
    endearment. That&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re using the term as well.
</p>
<p>
    <br>
    It was interesting that no one suggested that the term &ldquo;lesbian&rdquo;
    made the title offensive... at least initially. But in follow-up discussions
    with some of you, the word &ldquo;lesbian&rdquo; clearly made you
    uncomfortable. A couple of you actually came right out and said so. Since
    the entire song is about a lesbian it seems reasonable for the term to be in
    the title. Furthermore, &ldquo;lesbian&rdquo; is the term used by this group
    to identify themselves. It is not one of the derogatory slang terms used to
    poke fun or to be offensive. The fact that everyone avoided calling out the
    word &ldquo;Lesbian&rdquo;, even though it was the word that caused their
    uneasiness, suggests just how uncomfortable people are even talking about
    lesbians.
</p>
<p>
    <br>
    Several people suggested that the title fetishizes lesbians. I followed up
    with those folks. If we replace the word “lesbian” in the title with other
    words, such as “car”, “dog”, “house”, etc., no one thought that it
    fetishizes.
</p>
<p>
    <br>
    As an aside, no one said why fetishizing something was offensive. In fact,
    a couple of feminists pointed out that fetishes themselves are harmless so
    long as there is no associated oppression, subjugation, and dehumanization.
    Clearly, in the lyrics of this song, there is no oppression, subjugation, or
    dehumanization.
</p>
<p>
    <br>
    Within this sample group, the term &ldquo;lesbian&rdquo; made people
    cautious and uncomfortable. Unfortunately, the only time a lot of people
    ever hear the term &ldquo;lesbian&rdquo; is when it is associated with some
    sort of human rights violation or prejudice. &nbsp;So, even when using the
    term in an innocent or light-hearted way, its association with human rights
    violations and prejudice issues seems to override everything else. In some
    of our follow-up conversations, several people admitted that it was simply
    the word &ldquo;lesbian&rdquo; that caused them to interpret the title and
    lyrics in a negative way.
</p>
<h1 class="c7" id="h.ky3u0mmf8lbk"><span>Specifics In The Lyrics</span></h1>
<p>Most of the comments I received described a more general feeling that the lyrics were offensive or that they might offend others. This makes sense in light of the negative connotations that people have in their minds when they hear the term "lesbian". &nbsp;In fact, only two of the responses made specific references to lyrics that they thought others might find offensive.</p>
<p class="c1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The first comment is listed below. It is representative of what many of you said, but it was notable in that it contained specific references:</span></p>
<p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1 c9"><span class="c25 c16">Yes I feel [it is] offensive. I feel unappreciated [sic] and [that it is] disrespectful toward lesbians. For example wagging her pelvis, just like a guy, most girls don&#39;t have the femme... This whole paragraph, etc. The attitude of the song is the same: from a straight man[&lsquo;s] angle, to see [a] lesbian in an odd way. The real lesbian will be angry [Grin emoji] but the melody of the song is great!</span></p>
<p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Let's parse this out:</span></p>
<p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<ul class="c4 lst-kix_y8vcuhew52t5-0 start">
  <li class="c1 c3"><span class="c16">&ldquo;The attitude of the song is the same: from a straight man angle, to see lesbian in an odd way&rdquo;. </span><span class="c0">If you mean that it&rsquo;s odd for a straight man to fall in love with a lesbian, yes that is the whole point of the song! It is an unusual topic, that&rsquo;s what makes it interesting. There is no reason to view this as offensive. He cannot help what he feels. The song explores his musings about her.</span></li>
  <li class="c1 c3"><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c16">wagging her pelvis, just like a guy&rdquo; </span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This tells us about something he finds interesting about this lesbian. Her behavior around cute girls is just like a guy&rsquo;s. It also suggests that she has a lewd  trait, just like some guys have. The fact that he&rsquo;s thinking about this trait tells us that he likes it, or at least he is curious about it. </span></li>
  <li class="c1 c3"><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c16">The real lesbian will be angry</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;. We&rsquo;ve  played this song to two lesbians to get their reaction. They were not offended. That said, these were people we knew. The reaction might have been different if we didn't know them.</span>
      <br><br><span class="c0">But just for a moment, set aside everything else and just consider the arc of the story in these lyrics: A young man falls in love with a lesbian... nothing offensive here. He is not in love with her in order to offend lesbians, he simply can't help what he feels. The young man has sexual musings about someone he&rsquo;s fallen in love with, that&rsquo;s what we as human beings do... again, no reason to take  offense here. </span></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>
The only other specific reference to the lyrics was related to the second verse:<br>
</p>
<p class="c1 c9"><span class="c25 c16"><br>
    Most girls just don&rsquo;t have the stuff<br>
    to play the part of the femme fe tough<br>
    She wonders sometimes, what it is like<br>
    to have what I have, and have it all night<br>
    To flash it, and wield it, admire it and feel it<br>
    and plunge it like a knife
</span>
</p>
<p>
    <br>
Lot&rsquo;s of sexual innuendo here (welcome to the world of pop-music lyrics).
Here is the specific comment:
&quot;the part where she says she wants what I have and she wants it all night
is problematic. It makes people think that lesbians are lacking.&quot;
Think about all other things this young man has revealed in the lyrics. He said
he will never ask her to change, he&rsquo;ll always love her, he&rsquo;ll
protect her, he&rsquo;ll be there for her when everyone else runs away. These
are not the thoughts of a young man trying to find fault with a lesbian. He
loves her. He is simply a curious young man, and he wonders what she thinks
about sexually.
