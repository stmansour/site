This is a little site I put together that has resources for people in the band.
The songs in the player contain isolated instruments and vocals to help you
learn your parts.  Be careful not to turn it up too loud until you hear the
isolated part you trying to learn. The background music is at a very low volume,
if you turn it up to before the isolated part comes in you'll blast yourself :-)


1.
the top bar has the mp3 player buttons.  You can also download any song using the
"..." on the right side of the controller (on some browsers you'll have to right-click
to get that dropdown menu).

2.
The next section down lists all the different isolated tracks available for that song

3.
The next section down provides some extra details for the song.  The green LYRICS
button links to special annotated lyrics:

The tempo is listed

Sections of the song are labeled (Verse, Push, Chorus, ...)

Harmonies are shown in bolded typeface

We can add notes on the right -- so they don't get lost and everyone can see them.
