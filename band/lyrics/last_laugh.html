f("verse",`I ain't lookin for a pat on the back
Don't wanna sound like someone to brag
But I'm the stud of the football team
and I'm doin' 2 cheerleaders, 
That's Becky and Jean
My teeth are shiny and straight
My Nikes are new
You're gonna need my approval if you wanna be cool
Here comes Tommy Johnson, the geek of the school
Hey Tommy, looks like'ya' dropped your books again`),

And It comes hard and fast
You better pace yourself boy
If you want the last laugh last`),

f("verse",`At night I party I'm workin' for the old man
College can wait, I'm takin' care of the tan
My schedule's busy with the girls I meet
At the high school games, it seems'll-never leave
My teeth are shiny and straight
My Nikes are new
You're gonna need my approval if you wanna be cool
What ever happened to Johnson, the geek of the school
What a loser, never see him anymore`),

And It comes hard and fast
You better pace yourself boy
If you want the last laugh last`),

f("verse",`Since my looks are my best quality
I sent some pics to some agents, so they can see
Then two months later got a call from a guy
Eight AM sharp remember your lines
(Finger snaps) My teeth are shiny and straight
My Nikes are new
You'll need my approval if you wanna be cool
When they get load of me the public's gonna drool,
Looks like no stoppin' me`),

And It comes hard and fast
You better pace yourself boy
If you want the last laugh last`),

f("bridge", `Walk into the office and what do I see
It's Tommy Johnson staring back at me
I dropped my script and said what do you know?
He said, I see 'em come, I) see 'em go`),

f("verse",`Your teeth are shiny and straight
But I'll tell you the truth
I need a guy who can walk-the-dogs and shine all my shoes
And on weekends the help gets to swim in the pool
Now you're livin'in my world`),

f("chorus",`What goes around comes back around
And It comes hard and fast
You better pace yourself boy
If you want the last laugh
If you want the last laugh
If you want the last laugh last`),
