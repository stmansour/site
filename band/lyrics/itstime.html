f("verse",`I drive past your house
See your silhoutte, 
kissing with some boy
that hasn't made you yet


I'm layin' on horn
I'm flashing up lights
I'm yelling like your daddy
Tell that boy good night`),

f("chorus", `It's time, to make you mine
It's time, girl your so fine`),

f("verse",`I can't stand th&nbsp;pressure
I can't take heat
I can't go on livin'
The way you're treatin' me

My heart is in your hands
My head is on a plate
My body's just shakin' 
like fryin' rattle snake`),

f("chorus", `It's time, to make you mine
It's time, girl your so fine`),


f("chorus", ""),

f("bridge",`Hear the clock a'tickin'
Smell the burnin' fuse

My brain is all on fire
My lips are turnin' blue
If I don't get your lovin'
My heart will go ka-boom`),

f("bridge",`The clock has stopped a'tickin'
We're at the point of truth

Somethin's 'bout to happen
Let's count it down from ten,
Girl I'm 'bout to thrill ya',
And, I'm telling you again`),

f("chorus",""),

f("verse",`Girl I'll make you happy
Just make me your man
I'll buy you gold and diamonds
Stocks and bonds and land

I'll lie to make you happy
I'll steal to make you stay
There's not a price in heaven
That I wouldn't pay`),

f("verse",`Your pushin' all my buttons
You play me like the fool
But as long as we're playing
I like what you do

Your dress is all in tatters
You haven't got a hat
But baby you don't need them
To give me a heart attack`),

f("verse",`I go to the diner
You say your working late
But I saw you and Johnny
Down at Harry Truman Lake

I shot out his back tire
I told ya' &quot;come on home&quot;
It's just my way of saying
Honey, don't leave me alone`),

f("verse",`Baby, if you wanna' kill me
Just keep doin' what you do
I ain't opposed to dyin'
When it comes to you

I'd rather I be buried
Just to see you cry
Then to see you makin' time
With another guy`),

f("bridge",`It's time for you to love me
It's time you wear my ring
It's time to hand it over
And spreading out your wings`),
