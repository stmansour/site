  You got me climbing the trees
  Bangin' the drum
  For cute little lesbians`),

  Ohhh ohhh, but to me
  It's not worth it to mention
  Ohh, Ohh
  She's smilin' like Elvis, when she sees that hot little girl go by
  Waggin' her pelvis, Just like a guy`),

  Ohhh ohhh
  To play the part of the femme-fe-tough

  To flash it, and wield it, admire it and feel it and plunge it like a knife`),

  Ohh, ohh
  A little look my way
  You might even like it
  What's gettin' in our way
&lsquo;Cause I know you girl, I know how you think,
  that man's at his best when he's fixin' your sink
  But, who better to covet your gender and love it,
  and protect you while you sleep`),

  Me and you and your little girlfriend
  Me and you and your little girlfriend too`),
