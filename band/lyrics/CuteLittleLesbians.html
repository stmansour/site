  For cute little lesbians`),

  Ohhh ohhh, but to me
  It&rsquo;s not worth it to mention
  Ohh, Ohh
  She&rsquo;s smilin&rsquo; like Elvis, when she sees that hot little girl go by
  Waggin&rsquo; her pelvis, Just like a guy`),

  Ohhh ohhh
  To play the part of the femme-fe-tough
  She wonders sometimes, what it is like, to have what I have, and have it all night
  To flash it, and wield it, admire it and feel it and plunge it like a knife`),

  A friend, well, I won’t refuse

  Ohh, ohh
  A little look my way
  You might even like it
  What&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; in our way
&lsquo;Cause I know you girl, I know how you think, 
  that man&rsquo;s at his best when he&rsquo;s fixin&rsquo; your sink
  But, who better to covet your gender and love it, 
  and protect you while you sleep`),

  Me and you and your little girlfriend
  Me and you and your little girlfriend too`),
