The memories it conjures can't find their way out of my head

I want you near me,
I want to say what I wish I had said`),

First I'd kiss you - say a few magic words
And the history I wanted with you has occurred
 And your heart would be mine
If I could reach back in time`),

Your smile my addiction,
The taste of your lips stirring hopelessly 'round in my mind
I will, make one proposition,
Come back with my now,
through the black's of my eyes`),

The present my prison
Changing my past 
is the only way out`),

First I'd kiss you, say a few magic words
And the history I wanted with you has occurred

Miles in space
Still the bookmark
has not lost its place`),

Help me reach back in time`),
