Won't you lend me your ears
I've got something to say
Been building up for years

Some folks will tell you
Money's no-good stuff
But you know deep inside
That they can't get enough`),

If the price is right
Oh you say they won't

A loan from a friend
I don't care where it comes from
I need some to spend
I can't stay home much longer
And stare at these walls
I need money to spend
Or do nothing at all`),

Or a Broadway show
Anything you do
Every place you go takes Money`),

Has an admission fee
My girl once said you don't need money,
That love's the key
You gotta be kidding`),

But I think I'm right
If you do it wrong
You can make it right with money`),

I need it oh so bad
Hey... you know what to bring
It can buy you anything
And yes you know that money's alright`),
