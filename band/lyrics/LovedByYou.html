Just to be loved by you
I'd pay it twice
You can believe it's true
Give up all my possessions
They're no longer so dear
This is my confession
That I want you to hear`),

Just to be loved
Oh loved by you`),

f("verse",`When I hear you call
I'll come and rescue you
I'd scale any wall
If that's what I had to do
I'll bring you a candle
When you need light
Look through my heart's window
And see my motives tonight`),

f("chorus",`And that's to be loved
by you baby
Just to be loved
Oh loved by you`),

f("verse",`Give up all my possessions
They're no longer so dear
When I think of my wishes
One thing is abundantly clear`),

f("chorus",`I'd do anything
Just to be loved by you
Yea I want to be loved
Oh loved by you
Yea I want to be loved
to be loved oh loved by you`),
