Barnyard of My Mind


Darlin’ you left me standin’ here
Six years ago today
Holdin’ this sack of potatoes
Under my arms

But I still think about you 
And it makes me so happy
Yes it makes me happy
In the barnyard of my mind

Ever since you left here
The cows ain’t give no more milk
The pigs won’t even look at their slop

We all miss ya
Even the dog
Otherwise, why would he be chewin’ on what’s left of your house slipper

I fell in love with you in the barnyard of my mind
I fell in love with you in the barnyard of my mind

Why don’t you come on home
Where you belong 
And make me happy
The way you do
In the barnyard of my mind

Your smile is the fertilizer of our love
So leave all your troubles in the outhouse
The way you do in the barnyard of my mind

Make me happy like you do in the barnyard of my mind  (3 times)
