f("verse",`He worked hard
Every day
Sundays went to church
Taught his children how to pray

But when the troubles of Wall Street
Came to town
The orders all dried up and
The factory got shut down`),

f("push",`He worked hard all his life
For the company, his little boy,
His daughter and his wife
And when they took his home
He sent them to his inlaws
So he could strike out on his own`),

f("chorus",`Singing Lord you've laid me low
There's no jobs and there's no work
And there's nowhere left to go
And when things seem at their worst
You just add on another load
To carry down this
Cold Dark Road`),

f("verse",`I remember
When I was still a man
Every other Friday
Put my paycheck in her hand

On weekends we would be out in the yard
The kids play on the swingset
As we worked on our cars`),

f("push",`People I've known all my life
Lost everything they worked for
Left without a single dime
As they moved out one by one
The lights went out on this town
Like the setting of the sun`),

f("chorus",`Singing Lord you've laid me low
There's no jobs and there's no work
And there's nowhere left to go
And when things seemed at their worst
You just add on another load
To carry down this
Cold Dark Road`),


f("bridge",`<b>I was taught to fight
For what I know is right
But who I need to find (fight) will not come out
As they weave their webs
Sleep in expensive (their feathered) beds
Paid for by the sweat that
For years came from my brow</b>`),

f("chorus",`Lord you've laid me low
There's no jobs and there's no work
I got no place left to go
And when things seemed at their worst
You just add on another load
To carry down this
Cold Dark Road
To carry down this
Cold Dark Road
Lord why is it me that's on this
Cold Dark Road
`),
