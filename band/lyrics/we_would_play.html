    f("verse",`Midnight, Kansas City, at the local studio 
Waiting in the wings for everyone to go home
The players got tired, they called it a wrap, 
They gave us the keys, and said &quot;you top that

We laid down tracks from dusk until dawn (75th &amp; Troost)
Livin' on tacos (&amp;Big Gulps) &amp; junk yard dogs
In the morning, they'd come in, and we'd give 'em a play
They'd nod to the beat and say, "You boys are OK"`),

  	f("chorus",`In those days,
We would play,
Sparks flew from cymbals &amp; guitars
The tape spun like wheels on cars`),

	f("", `You hate the world silly girl
Mercury Queen don't go
Ya' know money's all right
Take a little chance, lay your heart down on a number`),

	f("verse",`High tech called Steve to the Silicon show
Matt packed his bags, came to Cupertino
They kept on writin'&nbsp; &amp; started a band
But as often with youth, everybody had their own plan
The pegasus flew, the pegasus crashed,
Bonds were broken, dreams were dashed
And everyone went their own separate ways,
Girls were married and new plans were made`),

	f("bridge",`Different towns, different worlds
More than twenty years, not a word,
But the tunes never stopped swirling round in their heads,
Sometimes it takes time to know what it meant`),

	f("verse",`It was fate,
That we should play,
Sparks fly from cymbals and guitars,
No one's thinkin' 'bout bein' a star`),

	f("chorus",`We just play
And we play
Just play
And we play and we play, and we play, and we play
Making songs, gettin' hot and rockin' all day`),
