f("verse",`The garden where we used to walk
today is marked with body chalk
where my dreams died and fell
How does love become a curse
or a rich man die from thirst
or heaven become hell

You told me that you loved me
Then took it all away

You know you popped my red balloon
served a steak with just a spoon
stood an inch to far away
When I had never loved before
someone so much I adored
such a waste and such a shame`),

f("bridge",`I need a change of venue
It's time to take the pain`),

f("chorus",`I will be ready
I will be strong
To swim to shore before I drown
I be steady
When I walk into the storm
I will
gonna pack and leave this town`),

f("verse",`I have lingered way too long
Where I know I don't belong
But where I want to be
The suit looks so good on the rack
But looks atrocious on my back
As everyone can see

She's looking at me
Like why is he still here
The taste of shame still in my mouth
How did this all come about
Once, she wanted only me
It's time that I take back my pride
Kill this love and watch it die
And wake up from this dream`),

f("bridge",`A wreck of twisted metal
Shedding a gentle tear`),

f("verse",`I will,I'm ready
I will be strong
To swim to shore before I drown
I will be steady
When I walk into the storm
I will
Gonna pack and leave this town`),


f("chorus",`I will,I'm ready
I will I'm strong
To swim to shore before I drown
I will be steady
When I walk into the storm
I will
Gonna pack and leave this town`),

f("outro",`I will, oh,
This storm will never knock me down
I'll be strong, yea, yea
I will get through just fine
Yes I will
Gonna pack and leave this town

I will
yes, I will see this through`),
