f("verse", `When my wife leaves home each morning
she puts into my hand
a crisp new $20 bill
and this is what she says:
Try doing something useful...
Maybe like a job
But when I hear that door goes SLAM!
I'm the twenty dollar man`),
f("verse",
`And now I go out lookin'
How this twenty should be spent
And workin' on my story
about where the money went
'cuz you know I love the ladies
and you know they love me too
they ain't no crime in lookin'
if lookin's all I do...
...oww
look at that, look at that
you tall cool drink of water
just reach in to the pockets of my pants
and you'll know
I'm the twenty dollar man`),
f("chorus",
`Twenty dollar, twenty dollar man
the man's got a twenty dollar bill in his hand
It's OK, it's alright
the man make a twenty dollar bill last all night
Twenty dollar, twenty dollar man
the man's got a twenty dollar bill in his hand 
Livin' it up while he can
I'm the twenty dollar man`),
f("verse",
`Don't know what's in the bible,
the vedas or koran
But I do know there's a twenty dollar
bill here in my hand
So gather 'round you lovely ladies
Let's order up some food
And pour that Southern Comfort
That puts me in the mood
Livin' it up, livin' it up
Come on, tell me how you can
I'm the twenty dollar man
Livin' it up, livin' it up 
Actin' like it's 15 grand
I'm the twenty dollar man`),
f("outro",
`Twenty dollar , he the twenty dollar man
give it on up for the man with twenty dollars
Two tens, four fives, the man can make it last all night
Twenty dollar man, uh-huh, gimme gimme`),
