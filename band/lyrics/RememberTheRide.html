The young pair go out for a ride
Their map isn’t clear, the couple gets lost
The waters begin to rise`),

To get their own piece of the pie
They move their way up, but now have new dreams
How they want to live their lives`),

Your never closer to paradise`),

Hoping that you've  raised them right
They hop into cars of lover’s  their own
heading into the tide`),

    f("push",`Beginning the journey of time`),

    f("verse",`Where are we going, where have we been,
With husbands and children & wives
The circle of life has gotten so big
That now it appears a straight line
Riding into the sunset of time`),

    f("chorus",`Remember, enjoy the ride
You're never closer to paradise
Remember the ride`),
