Hide in the dark
Gonna make a meal out of someone looking for love
Singing my tune
Baiting a mark
I&#39;m taking everything she&#39;s got, and it&#39;s still not enough
Why do you still believe in fairy tales
That things too good can still be true
You thought your time had come for happiness
But that is not what&#39;s happening to you`),

f("chorus",`I&#39;m <b>big</b>, I&#39;m <b>bad</b>
I&#39;m a <b>sociopath</b>
I lie and paint wonderful dreams
Now, I&#39;m <b>gone from this place
Without a trace</b>
And I&#39;ve taken everything`),

f("verse",`Lying in wait
For susceptible hearts
Wearing Prada & Gucci (brands) preferably
I don&#39;t feel a thing
I just play a part
I&#39;ve only one concern and that is only me
How can I do this all so easily
Over and over again
So many people put their trust in me
Before they realize I&#39;m not their friend`),

f("chorus",`I&#39;m <b>big</b>, I&#39;m <b>bad</b>
I&#39;m a <b>sociopath</b>
Everything&#39;s part of a scheme
<div class="bg">ooo-ooo-ooo</div> 
Now, I&#39;m <b>gone from this place
Without a trace</b>
And I&#39;ve taken everything
<div class="bg">everything</div>`),

<div class="bg">This is not your world, this is his, you&#39;re just living in it
There&#39;s no give and take, only take, there&#39;s no giving in it

This is not your world, this is his, you&#39;re just living in it
There&#39;s no give and take, only take, there&#39;s no giving in it</div>

You&#39;re all
here just for me
Only <b>me</b>`,`bg vocal chants continue softly
 when lead vocal comes in`),

f("verse",`And now you don&#39;t believe in fairy tales
That things too good are never true
And there&#39;s no toll-free road to happiness
And lies are more seductive than the truth`),

f("chorus",`I&#39;m <b>big</b>, I&#39;m <b>bad</b>
I&#39;m a <b>sociopath</b>
You&#39;re just a puppet on strings 
All you <b>have has been drained
I&#39;ve nothing to gain
fait accompli</b>
So, I&#39;m <b>gone from this place
Without a trace</b>
As I&#39;ve taken everything
<div class="bg">This is not your world, this is his, you're just living in it</div>
And you're clinging to the dream
<div class="bg">There's no give and take, only take, there's no giving in it</div>
Lord, I'm a Sociopath`),
