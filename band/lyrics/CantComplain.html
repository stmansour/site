No I can't complain`),

Make me think aloud
Push me through the crowd
And deep inside I wish you well
Sometimes it's hard to tell
I know it's hard to tell`),

You know you can't complain
No you can't complain`),

Will you tell me what's to do
And I'll believe in you
Tell me, will you tell me where from here
You know it's all so clear
You know it's me and you
Me and you`),
