And it seems everything's upside-down
I'm hearing strange things
Am I even in the right town

I'm hearing some things
That really don't make sense to me
That what I heard wasn't said
And what I saw they say I didn't see`),

Once showed us the way
Now it's a chaotic fool's parade`),

The Hatter is Mad
There's monkeys with wings 
[ Off with their heads
  Cries the Emerald Queen ]

The birdie spews out stories
fact-check-free

  Are all make-believe ]

Did I hear you right?
If I get what you mean 
My friend, those are some
Strange, strange things`),

Taking orders from a Pumpkin Galout
He says attack my attackers, don't let them talk
Don't let them out of their hovels, or go for a walk

Chase them, chase them
And track them down
Sieze them, don't let them
Take my crown`),

And I'll tell you the lies
All the favorite ones you idolize

The Pumpkin Head's horses
And all of his men
Could never put the truth back together again
And they would never speak the truth again`),

There's monkeys with wings

  Cries the Emerald Queen ]</i>

Birdie's spewing out stories

  The more we believe ]

And if that's what you really think 
those are some
Strange, strange things`),

That was posted by Q
And hold it sideways in the light of the moon
