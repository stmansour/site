But it's so hard on my heart
I just want to wrap you up,
and feel you in my arms
I dream that we're makin' love,
But girl I understand
That dreams are not the real thing,
But this is all I have`),

But I can't hold you, darling
I'll wait (forever, but if it) never comes,
Don't wake me from this grace,
Is that asking too much, and I'm way too deep in love`),
