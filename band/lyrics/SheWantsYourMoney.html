But she needs more, love ain't enough
You want a ride to give you a thrill
But she wants somebody who's going to
Pay her bills`),

She wants your money`),

Benjamin Franklin and all of his friends
These are the men on whom she can depend`),

You'll have to bid the highest amount
Your talk and bullshit won't get it done
You'd best get ready she ain't looking for love`),

She wants your money
She wants your money
and then she's gonna love you tonight
Can't you see, she just wants your money now
and then she's gonna love you tonight`),
