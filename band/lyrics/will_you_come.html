With a picket fence all painted white
If I gave two children named Teddy and Jill
And we loved them the whole of our lives

When I'd come home from work, and walk up the road
You'd hear me calling your name
And you'd see me smile as you answered back
And we'd kiss when you opened the gate`),

Next to me at night
Forever, if that's not enough`),

 Love you until
 The world stops circling the sun
You'll never fear
 As long as I'm m near
 There's nothing you'll have to run from
 If I do all this and I only ask for your love
 Will you come`),

	f("verse",`If I built you carriage with white satin seats
 And drove you each Sunday through town
 If I made you a drink that was cool and was sweet
 In the green grass laid you down

If I wrote you song, and it made you cry
 Then a story that made you laugh
 And when we heard the music's centrifical beat
 We would hold each other close as we danced`),

 And the moon from the sky
 And in my eyes you will always be young`),

	f("chorus",`I swear I will
Love you until
The world stops circling the sun
You'll never fear
As long as I'm near
There's nothing you'll have to run from
If I do all this and I only ask for your love
Will you come`),

Love you until
The world stops circling the sun
You'll never fear
While I am near
There's nothing you'll have to run from
If I do all this and I only ask for your love
Will you come`),
