Was it thunder
When you looked into my eyes
I don't need this form of comfort
It will just turn into lies

I don't need you standing closer
I don't want to take your hand
I have built a fortress of metal
and it surrounds me where I stand`),

Of the impending Tsunami</b>
Approaching like a drowning wall of love`),

I have faced it all before
And the stakes are my survival
nothing less and nothing more`),

    f("chorus",`<b>If you come on, warm and tender
I will never, ever surrender</b>
To the fatal call, this drowning wall of love`),

    f("bridge",`You tell me that I&#39;m lonely,
But I choose to be alone
This heart of glass,
Is a heart of stone,  heart of stone`),

I will never, ever surrender</b>
To the fatal call, this drowning <b>wall</b>`),

    f("outro", `The sirens' song calls out to me
But I know the danger
A heartache that never leaves
And it burns at the center
I have my memories
Gonna stand like a stone
Safe from heartache
Safe with my wall`, "bg vocals are 4 part and are a pad,<br>stay at least 6 inches back from the mic"),
