<h1>Downloading This Music For Free</h1>
<p>
    For now, all the music on this site can be freely downloaded for your
    listening enjoyment.  This may change in the future, so if you like something
    you should probably download it now.  Once this music goes
    on places like Spotify, Apple Music, and the like, I'm not sure
    if it can still be free.
</p>
<p>
    Today, getting the files is straightforward. But you need to download them
    to your computer first. A second step is needed to put them onto your
    hand-held devices.  If anyone reading this knows a better way to do this,
    please <a href="mailto:sman@stevemansour.com?subject=Downloading audio files">
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">email me</span></a>
    and I'll post your solution (after trying it, of course :-).
</p>
<p>
    There are websites you could use that will extract the audio from YouTube videos
    and let you download them in multiple formats. But I don't have all my music
    on YouTube. With the download method described below, you get any song I've posted on
    this site.
</p>
<h2>How To Download Audio FIles</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Go to <a href="https://stevemansour.com/music" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">https://stevemansour.com/music</span></a>
        and select the album, then the song
        that you want to download.  If it's a Christmas song then go to
        <a href="http://www.stevemansour.com/ChristmasSongs" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.stevemansour.com/ChristmasSongs</span></a>
        then select the song you want.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once you've selected a song, its name will appear above the player transport.
        For example, if you selected Broken Glass, it will look like this on the
        Chrome browser:<br>
        <img src="../images/playerTransport.png" alt="" align="center"><br><br>
    </li>
    <li>
        This step varies, depending on the browser you're using.
        <br><br>
        Chrome : click the 3-dots on the right side of the transport.  This will
        bring up a menu with a Download command.  Click the Download command
        and the audio file will be saved to your Downloads directory. Now you can
        load the song into your favorite audio player app.<br>
        <br><br>
        Firefox : right-click the transport area, it will pop up
        a menu, then select Save Audio As...<br>
        <br><br>
        Safari : right click the triangle play button on the left
        side of the transport. That will pop up a menu, then select
        Download Audio.
        <br><br>
        Opera : works exactly like Chrome, see above
        <br><br>
        I have not tried this on other browsers, or on Windows. I'm assuming that
        one of the methods described above, or some close variant, will provide
        the same download functionality.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Loading Audio Files onto an iPhone or iPad</h2>
<p>
    There are two ways I have found to do this. If you know a better approach, please
    <a href="mailto:sman@stevemansour.com?subject=Downloading audio files">
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">email me</span></a>
    and I will update this page.
</p>
<h3>Method 1 - iTunes Sync (free)</h3>
<p>
    You can use iTunes to sync your iPhone and/or your iPad with your computer.
    I'm sure this method would be Apple's preference.  It can be slow, but it works.
    <ol>
        <li>If you don't already have it, download and install iTunes for your Mac or PC</li>
        <li>Import the songs you've downloaded into iTunes using the File->Open command.</li>
        <li>Connect your iPhone or iPad to your computer using the USB (or USB 3) cable</li>
        <li>Click the icon for your device to configure what you want to sync to your device:<br>
            <br><img src="../images/iTunesSync1.png" alt=""><br><br></li>
        <li>Now under Settings, click Music. Configure this however you wish. You can
            select music by Artist, which syncs all songs by that artist, or by Albums, where
            you select the specific albums you want to sync to your device.</li>
        <li>Press the Sync button.  This should copy all the songs you've selected to your device.</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<h3>Method 2 - Use An App (not free)</h3>
<p>
    I used Method 1 for years. But the sync times just got longer and longer.
    One day I finally got tired of waiting 10 minutes just to get a single new song
    onto my phone. I bought a copy of
    <a href="https://softorino.com/waltr/"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Waltr 2</span></a>
    and life was good again. This is
    not a promo for Waltr 2, they're not sponsoring me in any way, and I'm not
    representing them in any way.  I bought my copy of Waltr 2. Now I can put a
    song my iPhone or iPad
    just a couple of seconds. Plug your device into your computer,
    drag an audio file from the Finder
    and drop it onto Waltr 2 and it shows up in your device, right where it should in iTunes.
    That's it.
    It works for other types of files too, docs, videos, etc. But I only use it for
    audio files, and it was totally worth it for me.
    It really doesn't get any simpler or more convenient.
