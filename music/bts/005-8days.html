                    * * * UPDATE * * * September 4, 2020 - I am happy to report the
                    very unexpected outcome of my dispute: United Music Group
                    dropped their copyright claim against my video. So, I have
                    now made this video available on YouTube. I didn't think
                    this would be how it turned out, but I am very happy with
                    the outcome!
                </p>
                <p><hr></p>
                <p style="font-style: italic">Original post, Aug 9, 2020</p>
                <p>
                    On August 2, 2020, I uploaded my video for Eight Days A Week
                    to YouTube. Once uploaded, YouTube puts videos through a
                    "processing" phase. It scans them to see if they use any
                    copyrighted audio or video clips.
                    If it finds something, the
                    video may be blocked and no one will be able to see it.
                    Technically,
                    creating a cover version of someone else's song and putting
                    it up on YouTube is a copyright violation. Fortunately,
                    YouTube is not looking for this (yet). But, again, if they
                    detect the use of any copyrighted audio (for example, a
                    record or cd audio track) there's a good chance it will be blocked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the processing for my Eight Days A Week video finished,
                    it was immediately
                    blocked. I got flagged with a copyright infringement.
                    The "processing" claimed that certain areas
                    of my audio track
                    were taken from the Beatles 2000 Digital Remaster
                    of Eight Days A Week.
                    At first, I thought this was a practial joke.
                    But it was not. The video is currently blocked on YouTube.
                    I did set out to faithfully recreate the
                    Beatles' arrangement, but this is crazy.
                    Just for the record, I would never use
                    anyone else's recording and claim it was mine.
                    I recorded all the
                    voices and instruments myself in my home studio.
                    The "processing" detection algorithms
                    just got it wrong. If you listen to my version, you will hear
                    that it is not the Beatles recording, not their voices, not their
                    instruments, not their handclaps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My options were to let them remove the audio from the areas
                    in question, or dispute the claim.
                    I chose to dispute. I even offered to let them review
                    the individual tracks that I created in Pro Tools.
                    The copyright owner has 30 days to review the
                    dispute and decide whether or not they want to drop the claim.
                    The copyright owner is UMG (Universal Music Group, in Santa Monica, CA).
                    If they listen to it I'm sure they'll hear that I didn't use
                    the Beatles' recording. I'm concerned that they may do nothing
                    at all, which means this video will be blocked forever on
                    YouTube.
                </p>
                <!-- <p>
                    Many other YouTubers have complained about this problem. Some
                    of them have YouTube channels where they take famous recordings and break
                    down the tracks, let you hear them isolated, and discuss how
                    the tracks were made and some details to notice and appreciate.
                    It's very educational and I love those videos (for example,
                    check out what Rick Beato does).
                    And I sympathize with their points. Their
                    videos actually benefit the copyright holder. They are mad and
                    frustrated that their videos got blocked.
                </p> -->

                    There are alternatives to
                    YouTube. Vimeo is a great alternative site.
                    That's where I chose to put
                    this video. So, at least the people on my email list (and
                    anyone you decide to forward this message to) can see it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The dispute
                    is still being reviewed at the time of this writing. If
                    UMG agrees to drop the copyright
                    claim then the video will be available on YouTube and I will
                    send out a quick note.
                    But I fear the most likely outcome is that it will
                    only be available on Vimeo. This is one of those times when
                    I really hope I'm wrong.
