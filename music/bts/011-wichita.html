                    I promised myself that for 2022 I would find a way to post
                    music videos more often. I'm slogging through a backlog of
                    more than 13 videos now, and the most technically challenging
                    vids are the highest priority (of course they are). It's
                    causing quite a backup.
                    One of my ideas was to make a video from my personal practice
                    time. I try to run through
                    a few songs every day just to keep myself from getting too rusty.
                    Why not just record those and see what happens? So I gave it a go.
                    The camera setup was pretty simple: one in front, one to the side,
                    and one clamped to the headstock on my acoustic guitar. The
                    recording setup was also very simple, one guitar mic and one
                    vocal mic. Then I pressed all the record buttons and blasted through
                    my little rehearsal session. I listened to a
                    few seconds of each one, picked Wichita
                    Lineman, and cobbled together this
                    video in a couple of hours. Pretty painless compared to my other
                    videos. :-)

                <h3>My First Truss Rod Adjustment</h3>
                <p>
                    When I was running through some numbers that I wanted to try for
                    this video I noticed that the high E-string on my Gibson
                    SJ-200 was buzzing.
                    This sort of thing happens on guitars sometimes, even on the finest
                    instruments. Their necks can warp
                    ever-so-slightly and cause problems like this. Most guitar makers
                    these days embed
                    a metal truss rod into the neck that can be adjusted fix
                    these kinds of problems. Normally, I don't mess with truss rods.
                    I get my guitars serviced by
                    a tech periodically because many things get out of whack on
                    stringed instruments over time and the correct fix is not always
                    obvious.
                    My guitar tech is Steve Crisp at The Guitar Shop in Santa Cruz, California.
                    Steve is truly amazing with guitars. He has found and fixed issues
                    on some of my stringed instruments that have baffled others.
                    This is not a paid advertisement or anything - I'm not being
                    compensated in any way. Many of the people on this distribution
                    list are guitar players. Good
                    guitar techs are hard to find. Steve was referred to me by a friend.
                    If you are in need of someone to work
                    on your guitar, you will not find a better tech than Steve Crisp.
                    Anyway, I was in a super-hurry because I wanted to record the
                    next day. I emailed Steve, described the problem, asked if head
                    could suggest a quick fix until I could bring the guitar in for
                    service. He replied with instructions for how to do a slight
                    truss rod adjustment, I made the adjustment as he described, and
                    the problem was fixed! Disaster averted!
