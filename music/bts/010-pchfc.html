                I always love working on harmony vocals. Harmonies can be
                my favorite part of a song. They can underscore the mood, or
                create a mood that can be powerful and moving. To work out
                harmonies for a song, I usually sing along with
                the vocal melody trying to stumble on something I like.
                Sometimes, the
                harmony naturally follows the chords or melody, but they
                can also be a counterpoint melody of their own. When working
                out harmony part for someone else to sing, I try to constrain
                it to something comfortable in the their
                vocal range. This year
                I tried something a bit different. Suzie Clark has a good
                range, so I wanted to try doing some Queen-style harmonies.
                That means that Suzie and I would each sing every part (the
                low harmony, the mid harmony, and the high harmony) on separate
                tracks. Then we combine them to
                produce a lush composite. So, I worked out some harmonies,
                and recorded myself doing each part. Then Suzy came over and
                we recorded
                her singing each part. I like to listen to the harmonies
                with everything else muted. It's something that's easy to do
                when mixing a song, but most people never get to hear that
                sort of thing. I thought you might find it kinda fun to hear
                just the harmonies, by themselves. Here's a few seconds of
                the harmonies in the first verse.

					James Reily played the harmonica solo on this video, making it the
					fourth time he's been on one of my Christmas songs. He has been
					a tremendous musician to work with over the years, whether it
					is playing live, working in the studio, or helping to arrange
					or produce original songs. He is very talented at all of it.
					He is currently finishing post-production on
					his own jazz album
					called Obstacles featuring some of the great players and
					friends he's worked with over the years. The album has five
					original pieces and two classic covers. Every musical thing
					James does is definitely worth listening to. Look
					for Obstacles in early 2022.

					For those who are familiar with my guitars you will
					probably not recognize the Telecaster-style guitar I used for
					the two rhythm parts on this song. That guitar is a
					prototype being readied for manufacture by Ken
					Bauer, who also happens to be the keyboardist for Gray Music
					Factory. Ken doesn't like guitars that weigh a lot (I can
					sympathize as I've played many all-night gigs with my Les Paul
					Deluxe... it weighs a ton). He asked me to give his prototype
					a try so
					I used it for this song. It is light as a feather! He must
					have done some serious hollowing to the body. The neck action
					was comfortable and easy on the fingers (though I did make a
					request for the neck itself to be slightly thinner). It also has some
					really unique active filters that provide great volume and
					tone variations. It sounded really good to me on this song.
					You will probably see me playing more Ken Bauer guitars in
					the future!
