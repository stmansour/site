                    First, I wanted to mention that for those of you who prefer
                    interacting on Instagram rather
                    than Facebook or email, I'm now on Instagram:
                    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/smanthegray/"><img src="../images/instagram.png" width="32"></a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's always such a pleasure to work with talented artists
                    like Suzie, she sings everything so well. But what makes it
                    a pure joy is that she is such a nice and caring person,
                    spirits are lifted whenever she's around. She's always
                    happy and excited to work on recordings and video projects.
                    Suzie gave me a short list of songs for this collab project.
                    I recognized all of them except
                    this song called "Steve McQueen by Sheryl Crow." When I
                    listened to it I immediately loved it... it opened with a
                    catchy riff, nice build through the verses, a strong chorus
                    with great harmonies in the chorus, and a lot
                    more. Since it was new to me and we both liked to song so much
                    it was the obvious choice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recording this song was pretty straightforward.  I listened
                    to the Sheryl Crow version a few times, then turned on the
                    recorder and started laying down tracks based on what I had
                    heard.  I think the verse and chorus chords are right, I'm
                    pretty sure my bridge (the "rap" section) chords are
                    different, but I think they
                    fit the song nicely. Every instrument got a chance to do
                    some fancy stuff here and there, which always makes a song
                    fun to play. Sheryl Crow plays the main riff on a telecaster,
                    but I keep my tele in open G alternate tuning (ala
                    Keith Richards) so I used my stratocaster instead. And I think
                    it sounded fine. I also used it for most of the leads. The
                    only other electric guitar I used was the ES335 for the stabs.
                    No deep reason for that... as I recall I was hanging back up
                    on the wall when I realized that I had forgotten to do the stabs.
                    The ES335 happened to be hanging right next to the strat, so
                    I grabbed it and used it. :-)  My trusty Jazz bass and the
                    go-to SJ200 acoustic guitar were my first choices and felt
                    right when I played them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I sent Suzie the basic tracks so she could rehearse the vocal.
                    She came over one evening and recorded the vocals, but it was
                    a warm day and I had a ceiling fan running and it totally
                    messed up her track.  So, she came back again to re-record
                    them.  Then I added some harmony vocals to the chorus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This song was a lot of fun to put together. It
                    also prompted me to rewatch the chase scene from Bullitt, which
                    is a pretty cool watch, even 54 years after it was made.
