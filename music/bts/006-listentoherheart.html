            &nbsp;Listen To Her Heart  (link to video)
        </a><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        I don't know how it is for others, but whenever I play at a live show the very first
        song is always scary. In the case of Solstice 19, Listen To Her Heart was first,
        and it was quite a bit more scary than most. Let me try to explain.
    </p>
    <p>
        We made a lot of changes that really helped us to improve our
        overall sound and how we practiced. And we planned to try them all
        out at the 2019 Summer Solstice Jam.
        The biggest change was our move to In Ear Monitors (IEMs).
        PA speakers are typically
        in front of the band. So audience hears the PA, but the band does not.
        The band needs something different to monitor the sound, especially
        the singers.
        IEMs provide (typically) wireless connections to
        a special mix of what goes to the
        PA system.
        The band wears earbud headphones to hear the mix.
        There are lots reasons why IEMs are
        so desireable. The two biggest reasons for me are (1) I can really hear
        myself clearly and (2) I can control the volume and keep it at a comfortable
        level --so my ears don't ring after we finish. For the person running
        sound, the great thing about IEM systems is that they virtually eliminate
        feedback -- that ear-piercing high pitched squeal that happens when mics are
        too loud or singers stay too close to their mics.
    </p>
    <p>
        With the IEM system we created, we were able to set up 4 custom stereo mixes.
        What I like to hear in my monitor is mostly my voice and the instrument
        I'm playing, then quite a bit lower than that I want to hear the drums so I can
        stay in sync with everybody, and finally, very little of anything else. It's not
        a balanced mix, but it's what I need in order to sound my best.
        We spent a lot of time at rehearsals
        getting all the monitoring mixes dialed in just right. After 3 or 4
        rehearsals everything was sounding really good, which made rehearsals so much
        more enjoyable. We just turned our system on, loaded our settings into the
        mixer and everything sounded great. We didn't use amplifiers -- we ran
        everything through the mixer -- our guitars, the bass, even the drums
        because we used an electronic drum kit. The sound was
        consistent at every rehearsal and we all heard what we needed to hear
        for our best performance.
        We recorded all of our rehearsals and we
        could listen to the stereo mix that got sent (or rather, would be sent)
        to the PA system when we played live. It was sounding
        really good. I was really looking forward
        to pushing our "in the box" mix to the PA system at Solstice 19.
    </p>
    <p>
        But when the time came, we got smacked with the
        reality of trying to take our setup live.
        First, all bands playing that day had to use the same drum kit, an acoustic drum kit, not like
        the electronic drums we had rehearsed with. There was
        no room for an additional electronic drum kit. And it was logistically not feasible to
        remove the acoustic drums and bring out the electronic drums just for our set.
        There goes the beat from the IEM mix. (Uh-oh.)
        But acoustic drums are loud so they'll
        cut through our earbuds and we'll still hear them, right?
        (um... yea, should work...). Oh yea, and there
        goes the balance between the drums and everything
        else that we had spent so much time dialing in.  (No, no, no! Not good!)
        Plus, we had heavy compression on the vocal mics. This was fine at our rehearsals
        because the only sounds the mics picked up were our voices. There were no amps and
        the drums were electronic. But at Solstice, the acoustic drums were set up
        right behind the vocalists mics.
        (Aw, crap! Sound the alarm!) I won't go into why, but in the case of our
        setup that was a really, really bad thing.
        Then, the bass guitar had to be plugged into an amp because the PA speakers
        were not really designed for a live bass guitar. (Our bass balance... gone???
        Are you kidding me?! Wait, our bass AND drum balance is gone! Noooo!)
        On top of that, in order to drive our IEMs we needed
        to use different microphones and cables than what the other bands
        used. (Jeez! We haven't started playing and this is already a disaster.)
        And we needed to run
        our mixer into the the venue's mixer in order to get our voices and guitars
        to the PA system. But there were no spare channels on the venue mixer.
        (No, no, no, no! How can this be?)
        So, Ari did a bit of research and found that with updated
        software in our mixer and the venue's mixer, we could connect them using
        a brand new special master / slave configuration so our mixer could be accommodated.
        (OK, heading into fantasy-land now.) We tried this and verified that it worked
        before the event. But the person running sound knew nothing about
        any of this or how our sound was coming into the venue's mixer.
        (WE. ARE. TOTALLY. F****D.)
    </p>
    <p>
        All of this was running through my head as we counted off and started
        our first number. The sound, the mix, and the blend is all very important
        to me -- so, I was really distracted from the music and worried about
        all those changes we made. Thankfully, I was able to hear my voice when I sang,
        which calmed me down a bit and I went into a more focused execution mode.
        The drums more than bled through. In fact, they
        were downright overpowering. But as long as I could hear my
        voice and a bit of my guitar, I can pretty much stumble through things.
        I don't remember much about the rest of our performance.
        We finished our set and, as far as we knew, there were no major issues.
        Afterwards, a few people told us that nothing came out of the
        left side of the PA system during our set.  Arrrggghhh! We had set up
        nice sounding stereo separation between
        the guitars and between the voices. But half of it was
        not heard -- like playing an album on your stereo system with one speaker unplugged.
        Had I known about the PA when
        we started to play my head probably would have exploded.
    </p>
    <p>
        But there was also something in the back of my mind that helped
        me keep it together. I knew I would be creating audio mixes and videos
        from this set.
        I could deal with almost any technical issue that may have affected
        the live sound.
        All of our voices and guitars (even the bass - via a "line out" connection
        from the amp) were being recorded in our
        mixer just like at rehearsals. The drum recordings
        would need to come from venue's mixer, but that would be the only unknown.
        Based on all my experience from the recordings of our rehearsals,
        I was pretty sure I could create reasonable sounding audio tracks.
        As it turned out, the drums did require a ton of work to sound right,
        but I won't bore you with those details.  We also had a 2 video recordings
        of the entire set. We had set up 3 cameras, two on the right, one on the left,
        but one of them was not working by the time our set arrived. And yes, of course,
        it was the left camera that failed. But, we got some video clips from
        people who were there to watch, which helped make up for the loss of the
        left camera video.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the end, in spite of
        all the issues, it was still a lot of fun, and people
        enjoyed it. The videos of our set are now complete in this

        I think they provide a pretty good view into how this
        group consisting of Mark Anenberg on drums, Suzie Clark on
        vocals, Ari Flink on guitar, Mikael Vidstedt on bass and vocals,
        and I all looked and sounded on that warm summer day in 2019.
        Hey! Since these recordings have both stereo channels it might
        even sound a little better :-)
