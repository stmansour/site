            When you hear the beginning of this song, you'll hear some guitar finger picking
            that sounds like it's being played on an acoustic guitar. But you'll see me picking
            what looks like a white Stratocaster. Those of you who play guitar know that
            a Stratocaster does not sound at all like an acoustic guitar.
            That guitar is called a Variax. It can play and sound just like a normal stratocaster.
            But it also has
            something very special. Internally, it has 60 different digitally sampled stringed
            instruments that can be played instead of the actual sound of the strings
            amplified through the pickups.
        </p>
        <p>
            Among the instruments available are some 6-string acoustic
            guitars and some 12-string acoustic guitars. I start by playing one of the 6-string
            guitars, and midway through the song I switch it to a 12-string. This is
            a great thing for guitar players who need to switch instrument sounds when playing
            live.  Another pretty cool thing about the Variax is that multiple guitar tunings
            are available simply by turning a knob. Even though the strings are physically
            tuned to "standard tuning", you can turn the knob and the tuning will change
            automatically. The Chain is played with a "drop-D" tuning -- I get the "drop-D"
            tuning with just a
            quick turn of a knob -- no need to physically retune any strings, no need to
            switch guitars, etc.  The Variax  works like a normal guitar when you use a
            standard guitar cord. To use the sampled instruments and the different tunings
            it must be connected with an ethernet cable.  I played that gig with an ethernet
            cable in my guitar :-)
        </p>
        <p>
            This is not a plug for the Variax and there was no
            sponsorship or anything... it's just an explanation for those of you who are
            watching an electric guitar being played but hearing an acoustic guitar.  No
            tricks going on here. That's actually what it sounds like when we play live.
        </p>
