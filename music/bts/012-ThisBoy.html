                <p>
                    This is a very special video for me for a couple of reasons.
                    First, it is a Beatles song. All Beatle songs are special
                    to me. I think their music
                    is the most timeless of any music ever written, arranged,
                    and recorded. I try to be faithful to the vibe and feel they gave to
                    their songs in their recordings. I do respect and
                    appreciate people who change the style or arrangement of
                    cover songs to make it their own. But I always seem to
                    like the Beatles' version the most. Maybe it's because
                    I heard their arrangement first and that sets my expectation.
                    Or maybe it's because the minds that
                    created the song also created the arrangement with the
                    same magic. Or maybe it's something else entirely.
                    Whatever the reason, that's why I stay faithful to their
                    style and arrangement.
                </p><p>
                    But the most important reason this
                    video is special is that I did it with my songwriting
                    partner Matt Kramer.
                    Matt and I have been writing music together since we were
                    teenagers. We've written hundreds of songs but we
                    haven't really recorded much together. What brought us
                    together as teenagers was our mutual
                    love of writing and creating our own music.
                    And as part of that process, we found
                    that we found that we both loved Beatle music.
                    We would often
                    jam together and play Beatle songs. We regularly played
                    This Boy with two part harmony, I sang
                    John's part, Matt sang Paul's. Matt does a great job of
                    covering Paul's vocal and I suppose we pulled the song
                    off well enough as a duet.
                    But I always lamented that we never had someone to sing
                    the third part (George's).
                </p><p>
                    Just before the COVID lockdown, Matt made a trip to my house.
                    We were going to be busy with a bunch of things, but on a whim I asked
                    him to pick a Beatles song and we would record it, something
                    we had never done before. He wanted to do This Boy.
                    So, I laid down some initial tracks and my vocal part.
                    I also added the part we were always missing (George's part).
                    When Matt arrived we laid down his vocal. We should have captured
                    the video while Matt was
                    singing his part, but somehow that didn't happen and Matt
                    had to shoot his
                    video from his house while under lockdown.
                    And finally, a little more than a year later, I cobbled
                    together this video.
                </p><p>
                    One interesting bit of trivia about this song is that the
                    first version the Beatles recorded had a guitar solo where
                    the bridge is now. George Martin did not like the guitar
                    solo, so they replaced it with a bridge that featured
                    a searing vocal by John. I never heard the solo that was
                    replaced, but I love the bridge they came up with.
