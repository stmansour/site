                <p>
                    This is a very special video for me for a couple of reasons.
                    One reason, of course, is that it is a Beatles song and any
                    Beatles song I record will always be special.
                    I think their music
                    is the finest and most timeless of any music ever written.
                    I want to do justice to their music and I try to be faithful to
                    the vibe and feel they gave to their music. I respect and
                    appreciate people who change the style or arrangement of
                    any cover song to make it their own. But I've never heard an
                    arrangement of a Beatles song that I like better than the
                    original version. Maybe that's because theirs was the first version
                    I heard, or maybe it's that the minds that created the song
                    also created the arrangement with the same magic, or maybe
                    it's something else that I can't express.
                    Whatever the reason, that's why I stay faithful to their style and
                    arrangement.
                </p><p>
                    But an even more important reason this
                    song is special is that I did it with my life-long musical
                    partner Matt Kramer.
                    Matt and I have been writing music together since we were
                    teenagers. We've written hundreds of songs together but we
                    haven't really recorded much together. Matt is a great singer
                    and I knew it would be fun and nostalgic for us to do a Beatles
                    song. What brought us together as teenagers was our mutual
                    love of writing our own music.
                    And as part of that process, we found
                    that we found that we had a shared love of the Beatles music.
                    We would often
                    jam together and play Beatles songs. This Boy is a song that
                    we played a lot, doing two part harmony (I sang
                    John's part, Matt sang Paul's) and wished we had someone to
                    do the third part (George's).
                    Just before the COVID lockdown, Matt made a trip to my house.
                    We would be busy with a bunch of things, but on a whim I asked
                    him to pick a Beatles song and we would record it, something
                    we had never done before. So, I laid down some
                    initial tracks, the vocal part I always sang, and the vocal
                    part we were always missing. When Matt arrived we laid down
                    his vocal. We should have captured the video while Matt was
                    singing his part, but somehow, we forgot and Matt shot his
                    video from his house while under lockdown. And I did the same.
                    And finally, a little more than a year later, I slammed it all
                    together in this video.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One interesting bit of trivia about this song is that the
                    original version the Beatles played had a guitar solo where
                    the bridge is now. George Martin did not like the guitar
                    solo and they worked out that bridge with John's searing
                    vocal.
