        <p>
          While I haven't released any music videos since Christmas 2020, I
          have been working on quite a few: 3 solo projects and 2 collabs.
          I will post those later this summer.
          But mostly, I have been working on the first video
          for my new band, Gray, which takes my videos to a whole new
          level. I had just completed another little segment of it, and
          I was feeling really out of touch. It's been a night and day
          effort for a few months now.
          I remember thinking that I was "a little too far gone."
          Then
          I remembered this song from Todd Rundgren
          I never
          understood the lyrics, yet somehow they seemed to capture my mood.
          I felt like I needed to get
          something done, something posted... right now.
          So, I decided I was going do
          Too Far Gone and post it, ASAP. I resolved to record the music and raw
          video tracks in one day and give myself another day
          to pull together the finished video.
          Getting this done was just what I needed to recharge.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, here it is,
          no fancy set up, nothing staged or planned, just my quick
          version of this lesser-known
          song by Todd Rundgren. As I watched it frome start to finish
          I realized that it also documents a lot about how I record music.
          So, now it's done and I can continue working on the other
          projects. :-)
