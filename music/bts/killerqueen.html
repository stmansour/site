        <!-- -----------------------------------START--------------------------------- -->

        <p>
        	One of the most recognizable things about Queen is their exquisite vocal
        	harmonies. They are lush, often unexpected and interwoven as
        	counterpoints to the song melody. They are also usually 3-part.
        	Covering a Queen song with all the vocal parts can be challenging.
        </p><p>
        	Most people find it pretty easy to pick out the melody of a song by just
        	listening and singing along.
        	Two-part harmonies (that is, a melody and a single harmony)
        	are not too hard to pick out, though not as easy as just the melody.
        	But 3-part harmonies, especially when 4 or 5
        	instruments are being played at the same time, can be notoriously
        	difficult to reverse engineer.
        	Sometimes, you can hear one or two notes clearly but there's that third part that's just
        	not quite loud enough.  You know it's there
        	but with all the other voices and instruments playing you just can't quite make
        	it out.
        </p><p>
        	To work out harmonies, bands do vocal rehearals. The entire rehearsal is
        	spent working out the vocal
        	parts. Typically, only the singers come to a vocal rehearsal, that way we don't
        	bore the other players to death.
        	Tish and I had a vocal rehearsal to work on the songs in the Solstice setlist.
        	When we got to Killer Queen we listened to
        	Queen's record. Hearing all those cool little vocal interjections during
        	the verses (3-part harmonies, all of them) I remember
        	thinking "man, this could take a while."
        </p><p>
        	When it came time to add the harmonies to the shelter-in-place video, I tried
        	to work out all 3 parts by just singing along with Queen's
        	recording. It only took a few seconds to realize this was never going
        	to work. So, I tried something that I often do when I'm working out 3-part harmonies
        	for vocals on songs that Matt and I write -- I played and experimented with the
        	harmonies on
        	the piano. Since we had already completed the instrumentation, I started by adding
        	the all parts that I knew were correct. I recorded them as individual notes
        	on the piano.
        	Then I could go to a section that was missing a harmony note, listen to the
        	instrumental accompaniment and the harmony parts I had already
        	recorded, and experiment.
        	I would play different triads that contained the 2 known notes,
        	trying out different third notes until I
        	hit upon something that sounded good. Then I recorded that
        	third note and moved on to the next unknown part. It didn't take too long
        	before I had full triads for all harmony parts for the whole song.
        	The rest was easy.
        	For the
        	high harmony part, I simply played back the song with the high note of each triad
        	turned on and the other two notes turned off, quickly memorized that
        	melody, then sang it and
        	recorded it. Repeat the same process for the middle and lower notes, and we're done!
        </p><p>
        	I have found this to be a very effective technique. You can try lots of different
        	triads very quickly.  It's possible to do this without the piano -- just
        	record your
        	voice one note at a time and experiment until it sounds correct -- but
        	it takes, literally, 10 to 50 times longer.
        </p><p>
        	I'd be interested to hear what people think this approach. Also, if you know
        	of another way to work out harmonies, or if you see an
        	improvement to what I've described, please reply. I'd love to learn any new
        	techniques that might work better.
        </p>
