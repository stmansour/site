					I asked my daughter Nicole about suggestions for this year's Christmas
					song. She pointed me to a Christmas album by Sia. I listened to it
					and I liked it a lot. In fact, I found myself humming
					one of the songs, Candy Cane Lane. It was a really strange
					song and I couldn't stop humming it for couple of days.
					Somehow, it reminded me of the music in Nightmare Before
					Christmas, which I love. It had a strange effect of being
					little bit spooky but still happy.
					One afternoon I sat down at my keyboard and started
					plunking out the chords to it. I wasn't really thinking of
					recording it at that point, I was just curious
					about the chords and melody. But as it came together, I
                    started to like it even more. So, just for grins I
					recorded a piano part and sang it a couple of times. Then I
					added a Hammond organ part, then another organ part. The instrumental
					rhythm parts were sounding pretty cool.  So, I added some drums and a bass
					guitar. It was definitely turning into a fun
					little song. Some of the embellishment parts just
					seemed to scream for a Mini Moog, which I used to add the intro and
					a few of the riffs. At that point I felt like I should just
                    finish it and use it this year. I hadn't set out to do it as
                    my annual Christmas song. It just sort of happened.
					The choruses seemed like they needed a female voice, so I asked
					Suzie to do them and some of the harmonies as well. When we finished
					her parts we were both pretty happy with it. The song
					has lots of strange vocal harmonies, and we both love that
					sort of thing.
				</p>
				<p>
					The visuals that came to mind for this song were colorful
                    and vibrant.
					I gave myself a couple days to see what
					I could create. They were created in Cinema 4D along with
					a few effects were done in Adobe After Effects. It also
					seemed like there should be some animated characters.
					That's something that can take forever, but I gave myself
					an extra couple of days to see what I could do to
					"up my game". It's not an epic animation,
					but I think it does add to the overall effect. There were
					a couple of jumping gingerbread cookies (of course) and
					some dancing mice (what fun would it be without
					dancing mice?). Their dancing was a bit
					odd... but it's an odd song.
				</p>
				<p>
					The instrument aficionados
					among you might have noticed
					a Mini Moog in the video. I got that Mini Moog when I was
					in high school. Its serial number places it in the
					first 1500 Mini Moogs ever manufactured. It was considered
					a pretty cool keyboard
					back then, and it is still being used by keyboardists today.
					Very few electronic keyboards have remained so popular for
					so long.
				</p>

					Finally, several people have asked me to include links to the
					the Christmas songs from prior years. In general, on YouTube you
					can find any song I've done by just doing a search for
					"Steve Mansour". Also, here is a
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZmfet0jOlw&list=PLR6N2YoW-c__gnFzBtIARV7Y7Hpu_zxgT">
					video playlist of all my Christmas Songs</a>.
					And finally, here a list with direct links to each Christmas song:
